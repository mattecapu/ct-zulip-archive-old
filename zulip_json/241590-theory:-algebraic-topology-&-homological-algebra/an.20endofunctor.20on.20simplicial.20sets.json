I find CWM's section on them to be a very straightforward elaboration of their basic properties. <br>\nI didn't appreciate how important they were until I started spending more time on enriched category theory in June/July. In the 2-category V-CAT, the unit for the tensor product of V-categories does not generally coincide with the terminal V-category, much like how in an arbitrary monoidal category we don't expect the unit object to be terminal. The upshot is that there is no way to speak about a \"constant functor\" from C to an object in D -objects in D are in one-to-one correspondence with functors from the unit object 1, but there might not be a canonical choice of functor C -&gt; 1 which makes this work. Even over Ab, for C an Ab-enriched category, there's no reason to expect there to be any additive functor to the one object category 1 with Hom(1,1)=Z, much less a canonical choice of one. (The terminal category 0 has Hom(0,0)=0, the zero abelian group). As a result the entire theory of limits and colimits all just falls apart, one cannot speak of the limit or colimit of a diagram in general. Maybe this all sounds trivial but it was quite striking to me. We have to use these weighted limits/colimits instead which are defined in terms of ends/coends.</p>",

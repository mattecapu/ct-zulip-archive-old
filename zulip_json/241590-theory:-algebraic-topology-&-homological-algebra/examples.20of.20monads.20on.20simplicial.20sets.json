I think such monads are automatically simplicially enriched, but I don't remember why.  The idempotent monads I mentioned earlier are also simplicially enriched, but for a different reason. But simplicial enrichment is definitely not automatic in general, and I think the monad whose algebras are symmetric simplicial sets is not simplicially enriched.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I know I've seen a there is a theorem that states that, unlike intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) where any cartesian closed category gives a model, if you try to define the structure on a category to interpret classical propositional logic (CPL) then you can show that the only models are preorders. This gives a precise sense in which (CPL) cannot be given the same kind of constructive interpretation as IPL and we have to change something to get a computational interpretation of classical logic (linearity, evaluation order, etc). </p>\n<p>But I'm not having any luck finding a reference. Does anyone have a good one? </p>\n<p>The only precise formulation I can remember is that if something is a biCCC then it has a strict initial object (Any A -&gt; 0 is an isomorphism) and so with classical logic the opposite category should also be a biCCC and so a model of classical logic would have a strict terminal object (Any 1 -&gt; A is an isomorphism) which would for example make <code>inl(): 1 + 1</code> and <code>inr(): 1 + 1</code> equal.</p>",

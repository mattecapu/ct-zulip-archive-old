HOL is a weaker logic than the calculus of constructions and dependent types are very natural for encoding category theory, so this is arguably an uphill battle, but I think the question is still interesting because automation in HOL leads automation in dependent type theory by a considerable margin at the moment. Reasoning in category theory is often very simple (equational reasoning is often all that is necessary for proving a diagram commutes) and so one would like to be able to take advantage of automation.</p>",

        "content": "<p>That's a pretty nifty definition of a category of sets.  Using Hom(1, X) in Set to pick out the elements of X is not unusual, so it looks promising just at a glance.  Would it be too much to expect that if T is a terminal object in S, the map from Hom(1, T) to the terminal objects of S would pick out T?  I don't suppose this is necessary, but it probably could be done for convenience.  Ah.  Looks like this is addressed on pp. 62–63 on the pdf you linked, with roughly the conclusion I expected:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The locale assumption <em>stable-img</em> forces t ∈ set t in case t is a terminal object. This is very convenient, as it results in the characterization of terminal objects as identities t for which set t = {t}. However, it is not absolutely necessary to have this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My first thought on how to make this definition appear more foreign (besides turning it into computer code, but given what stream this conversation is in, maybe that's me) is to take S to be a category with a unique terminal object (not just unique up to isomorphism), like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">S</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathrm{Set}^{\\mathrm{op}}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7376em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">Set</span></span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7376em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.1362em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathrm mtight\">op</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.  Glossing along as best I can on the linked pdf, it seems like that would be the context for a set theory where there is only one element and thus only one non-empty set.  This situation also gets a mention (on p. 75) in the pdf as \"the case of a degenerate universe with only a single element.\"</p>\n<p>The pdf at least indirectly mentions another \"perverse\" sort of situation that can happen that I didn't think of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We call a set category <em>replete</em> if there is an object corresponding to every subset of the universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So a set category that is not replete would have sets that don't have objects of S to represent them.</p>",

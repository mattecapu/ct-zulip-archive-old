HOL is a weaker logic than the calculus of constructions and dependent types are very natural for encoding category theory, so this is arguably an uphill battle, but I think the question is still interesting because automation in HOL leads automation in dependent type theory by a considerable margin at the moment. Reasoning in category theory is often very simple (equational reasoning is often all that is necessary for proving a diagram commutes) and so one would like to be able to take advantage of automation.</p>",

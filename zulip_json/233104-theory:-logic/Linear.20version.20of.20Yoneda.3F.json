We could modify this procedure by 1) demanding that the maps we collect pass a filter; and 2) collecting the results in something other than a set. </p>\n<p>i am particularly interested in the case where we demand that the maps are linear in some suitable sense and that the resulting maps are collected in a “linear structure”. Is there already a version of Yoneda that generalizes in this way? I know that there are enriched versions of Yoneda, which covers the second requirement, but what about the first?</p>",

That's where he had previously gotten his masters degree in computer science under Cristian Calude.  Calude and I served as his co-advisors for his Ph.D. Apart from a paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2067\">connecting thermodynamics to algorithmic entropy</a>, Mike and I worked on applications of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340\">symmetric monoidal categories</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1053\">compact closed bicategories</a> to computation. He has continued developing these ideas ever since, most recently working with my student <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> on a paper about type theory, making extensive use of ideas from topos theory.</p>\n<p>In 2016 he began a startup called Pyrofex.

He is a control theorist (of the Caltech tradition if that makes any sense) that has moved to applications in path planning (and robotics in general), safety guarantees, optimal control etc. but more from the mathematical engineering side. You can see here the types of papers he publishes these days with his group <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=jeNGFfQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=jeNGFfQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate</a></p>\n<p>I know he has had discussions with David Spivak in the past (or so he told me when I did my interview talk) so he is familiar with CT at some level.</p>",

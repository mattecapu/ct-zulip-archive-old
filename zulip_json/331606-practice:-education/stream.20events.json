Another would be to develop and socialize curricula to pragmatically share this with normal people, teachers, and of course children and students.</p>",

I have taught geometry, algebra, and workshop courses at the high school level, but now for several years I have been an adjunct instructor of undergraduate statistics, mainly at Endicott College, North Shore, MA. My real, urgent focus is on writing an algebraic and category-theoretic exploration of anti-reductionism. The working title is \"Life: Microlects and Mathematics\". If you like I can supply a rough draft for review as an attachment. (For the record, I might call myself an artistic mathematician.)</p>",

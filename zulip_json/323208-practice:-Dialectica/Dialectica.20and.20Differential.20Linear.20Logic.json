How far has this work been taken, and what connections to the Dialectica are there, if any?\"</p>\n<p>I replied that there has been lots of work on that. Peter Selinger  is the expert I know on that, he's written lots about it,<br>\ne.g. <a href=\"https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/papers/qpl.pdf\">https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/papers/qpl.pdf</a> or \"A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories\" and<br>\nthere's plenty more in <a href=\"https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/\">https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/</a>.</p>\n<p>More recently, work has moved to \"Differential Linear Logic\" instead of traditional Linear Logic</p>\n<p>Dialectica categories are good models of Linear Logic, I don't know if they're models of differential linear logic too or not. But I expect they are.<br>\n(it may be wishful thinking on my part, but Marie Kerjean and Pierre-Marie Pedrot also think they are and have a preprint called \"âˆ‚ is for Dialectica\", which I think is very cool, even if I don't understand most of it.</p>\n<p>That dialectica categories are (or not) good models of Differential Linear Logic is not obvious to prove, as people do not seem to have a very consensual idea of what are \"good\" models of Differential Linear Logic. But it's certainly a very interesting project. </p>\n<p>I am repeating this information here, because all want everyone to decide on which kind of problem they want to work on, and this is definitely another problem that I find very interesting indeed.</p>",

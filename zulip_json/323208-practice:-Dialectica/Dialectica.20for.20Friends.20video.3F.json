        "content": "<p>More questions:</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Tim Hosgood wanted to know if  people had worked out other dialectica categories that were not  over Sets. In particular he wanted to know about categories of spacesâ€”but see <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nice+category+of+spaces\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nice+category+of+spaces</a>. Nice categories of spaces are rare. if one likes topology one might want to do the Dialectica construction over \"sequential topological spaces\" (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sequential+topological+space)--a \"nice\" category of spaces described  by Escardo in the Topos Colloquium this week.</li>\n<li>Dialectica objects have a mapping from a double object into a simplified category, a lineale, L.  So we can write it as Dial_L(C) and we can vary both C and L and how they interact. The  (minor)  generalization I've done is described in the preprint <a href=\"http://researchgate.net/publication/2822237_Categorical_Multirelations_Linear_Logic_and_Petri_Nets\">Categorical Multirelations, Linear Logic and Petri Nets</a>, which was not published, but it was  explored a little in the  paper with Elena di Lavore and Wilmer Leal on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12801\">Dialectica Petri Nets</a>. Relationships to \"dynamical systems\" have not been studied: is there anything interesting to say here?</li>\n</ol>",

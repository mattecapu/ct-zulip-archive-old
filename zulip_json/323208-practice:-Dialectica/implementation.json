Agda with HoTT makes a distinction between more general <em>types</em> (think ∞-groupoid) and more specific <em>sets</em> (think an ∞-groupoid that is provably a 0-groupoid). So what they call a <em>category</em> has a further requirement that hom-<em>types</em> really are hom-<em>sets</em> that needs to be proven. Eric's already shown that Poly forms a precategory, with hom-types; what I've done here (with a great deal of help from lemmas from the Cubical Agda library) is further show that the category of polynomials where every position-type is a position-set and every direction-type is a direction-set forms a category, with hom-sets. (I don't think this should be too hard to generalize to Dialectica.)</p>\n<p>(There's something to be said about these constructions not really being Poly(Sets) or Dial(Sets) if we're coding them up this way—really, these are Dial([whatever category gives Agda its HoTT semantics]). This is a little too much type theory for me to think about in one sitting, though, so I'll just leave this vague parenthetical remark in case anyone finds musing on that interesting...)</p>",

Is there a natural way to view the category M_L(Set) used in the definition of the Petri net category Net_L as an example of the Girard variant GC for some appropriate choice of C? It seems like either there is a fundamental reason why it shouldn't be possible or there is some relatively trivial pairing that can be done and it was just written this way in the original paper in order to make the exposition cleaner. This is also of interest since reformulating M_L(Set) as GC for some C paves the way for a «modal» version of the constructions at play here, which is something I haven't really thought about myself much yet but know that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"380293\">@Eric Bond</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"343715\">@Nelson Niu</span> have expressed interest in.</p>",

We were wondering whether you have a particular reason for not trying to define the token game in the original Dialectica Petri nets paper. Eric and I gave a quite natural definition but found that it clashes with the notion that a 0 element of the base lineale L represents \"no arc\" as opposed to \"an arc with cost 0\". More  amusingly, the dependent Dialectica construction actually fixes this problem by creating a distinction between arcs of value 0 and the absence of an arc, so we're thinking we should redo the basic setup from your paper with dependent M_L(Set) in order to be able to use tokens how we want in our construction.</p>",

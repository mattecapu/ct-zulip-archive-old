Bruno wrote:</p>\n<p>#1 Dialectica seems to be a category of lenses with extra structure: objects are endowed with a relation and lenses are asked to preserve that. Does this make Dial a category of algebras of some monad on lenses?</p>\n<p>#2 If dialectica categories are lenses with extra structura, and lenses are cartesian version of optics, can we use this insight to obtain \"monoidal Dialectica categories\", i.e. a category of optics with extra structure?</p>\n<p>#3. In compositional game theory there is a notion of \"selection functions\" which interplay with the underlying lenses, telling us what the Nash equilibria of agents/players in a games are. Are winning conditions of Dialectica related to selection functions? Can we obtain one from the other?</p>\n<p>I've replied:</p>\n<p>for #1 there is a relevant paper by Pieter Hofstra, The Dialectica Monad and its cousins<br>\nHofstra, P in Makkai Festschrifft, 2011 The dialectica monad and its cousins, Pieter J. W. Hofstra, <br>\n<a href=\"http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/phofstra/dialectica.pdf\">http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/phofstra/dialectica.pdf</a> <br>\nthis is probably not the answer you want, but it is a kind of answer.</p>\n<p>for #2 I have a version of Dialectica over an smcc (symmetric monoidal closed category) described in<br>\n \"Dialectica and Chu constructions: cousins?\", Theory and Applications of Categories, Vol. 17, No. 7, pp 127-152, 2006. <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/17/7/17-07abs.html\">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/17/7/17-07abs.html</a>. </p>\n<p>But this is for the second kind of Dialectica categories (chapters 3 and 4 of my thesis). <br>\none should be able to adapt it? I don't know.</p>\n<p>for #3 the question I asked in our first meeting was related, but slightly different.<br>\n I asked if we simply added Hedges' notion of Nash equilibrium to Dialectica what we would get? <br>\nwhat does the notion of Nash equilibrium buy us?</p>\n<p>I can also ask questions and my first question is about the real applications of lenses.</p>\n<p>#4.  What are the real applications of lenses? do we have a list showing best applications and what they use of the categorical structure?</p>\n<p>#5 One can always generalize notions beyond their utility: this is why finding the right kind of abstraction for a type of problem is hard.<br>\nSure we can do Dial_2 (CAT) or Dial_2 (Cat) instead of Dial_2 (Set), if you prefer. but unless this generalization buys me results that I don't have for Set, I'm not very interested. What can we do with lenses over Cat that I cannot do with usual lenses? what kind of structure I am preserving and why?</p>\n<p>#6 the same idea applies to games with bidding: what can we do with these games? could we do it with dialectica spaces instead?<br>\nif yes, why do we want to do it? if not, why not?</p>\n<p>I think it's important for the MRC that we have a healthy/long collection of questions to work over the week.</p>",

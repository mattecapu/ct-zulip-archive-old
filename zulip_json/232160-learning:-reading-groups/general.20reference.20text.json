But I find that it really is worth it to try and find books that are easy enough - it feels like it's a more sustainable activity for me when I don't have to push myself too hard to make progress in a book. Gradually books become easier as I learn more, and it's exciting to return to a book that used to be too hard, but isn't anymore.</li>\n<li>If a book has solutions/hints/answers to exercises, that can be incredibly helpful. Otherwise it can take a really long time to realize one is missing something simple.</li>\n<li>I think it's mostly true that one \"uses everything one learns\" in a math context. So if you're not in a hurry to learn a particular thing, just learning about whatever seems accessible and fun/interesting can be a good way to go. It's hard to know how interesting/relevant a given topic is until one learns at least a tiny bit about it.</li>\n</ul>",

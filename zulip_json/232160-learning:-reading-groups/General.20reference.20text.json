        "content": "<p>Apologies for rehashing something that I'm sure has been asked before. But I am currently working through Emily Riehl's \"Category Theory in Context\". It's a great text, but I'm definitely lacking some of the math background needed to grasp many of the examples. My understanding of category theory thus far is mostly limited to the context of sets + programming analogies, and I'd like to slowly expand that to some of the more interesting and common crossover topics.</p>\n<p>Can anyone recommend a good general math reference text? My criteria is pretty loose, but I think I'm looking for a relatively broad text that covers some common topics in category theory in an introductory manner but with enough depth to work through some of the interesting applications of CT. Others probably know better than I do what counts as \"common crossover topics\", but I'm thinking along the lines of groups, rings, fields, topology, etc.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi gio!<br>\nI also am chipping away at that book as I'm able to. And I also find that I don't have the math background to follow many of the examples. In addition, I sometimes find the presentation a little bit tricky to follow.</p>\n<p>I'm currently very happy with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10642.pdf\">this</a> book \"Notes on Category Theory: with examples from basic mathematics\" by Perrone. It's based on that book by Riehl, but I've found it a little more friendly to follow given my background. The author suggests that Riehl's book could also be used as a second book after \"Notes on Category Theory\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf\">This</a> book \"Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory\" by Fong and Spivak is also excellent, with lots of examples/applications. Some parts of it are tough for me to follow, but a lot of it is really accessible.</p>\n<p>You might also possibly enjoy \"Conceptual Mathematics\" by Lawvere and Schanuel. (You can find a pdf by googling the title). I found the parts of this book that I've read really thought provoking - almost philosophical in nature at times.</p>\n<p>(I've also found it really helpful to have access to textbooks intended as a first introduction to crossover topics of interest. It can be quite fun to bounce back and forth between these books and then books that work with these topics in a category theory context. Usually one can find elementary textbooks on popular topics via googling.)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks all! I will definitely check those out. I should have been a bit more specific, but I am actually working through a whole stack of CT books (Riehl, Awodey's Category Theory, Fong and Spivak's Seven Sketches, and Milewski's CT for Programmers). It has been very helpful to jump around between books and often see the same things approached from different perspectives -- exploring the \"primordial ooze\" as Seven Sketches refers to it.</p>\n<p>I am definitely on the lookout for more CT books, but I'm also feeling like I've exhausted my non-CT math knowledge a bit, and would be able to understand CT topics more thoroughly if I also dove into the basics of some other math topics.</p>",

I don't know exactly what your background is, but I can share some of the books that I've found helpful for myself (I took the math classes required for an engineering undergraduate degree). </p>\n<p>Some introductory books I liked:<br>\nFor topology, \"Introduction to Topology: Pure and Applied\" by Colin Adams<br>\nFor analysis, \"Understanding Analysis\" by Stephan Abbott<br>\nI never found one I really liked for group theory. I ended up learning some from \"Algebra: Chapter 0\" by Aluffi, but it was a bit too hard to be efficient. I also tried working a bit on \"Contemporary Abstract Algebra\" by Gallian, but I found that a bit boring.<br>\nWhen I go back to learn a bit more group theory, I'm intending to use \"An Invitation to Representation Theory\" by R. Michael Howe.<br>\nFor linear algebra, I used the first part of \"Advanced Linear Algebra\" by Stephen Roman. This also got me interested in modules, although at the time I was reading this I found the section on modules a bit tough.</p>\n<p>A couple other books that look promising to me at an introductory level but I haven't tried to read yet: \"Linearity, Symmetry, and Prediction in the Hydrogen Atom\" by Singer; and \"Algebraic Topology\" by Butscher and Rubinstein-Salzedo.</p>",

More precisely, say I have a conjecture about equality of some morphisms in a new kind of category (ex: with a couple of monoidal structures, an involution, a couple more gadgets), and fiddling on paper leads nowhere. I'd like to throw this at an automated tool, just to see.</p>\n<p>Most automated provers are untyped, which makes reasoning about morphisms hell (partiality is not fun, especially when you know for a fact that it's all total). Advice?</p>\n<p>I've been thinking of seeing if something like one of Isabelle's sledgehammers might help. At least that would mostly hide the lack of types from me. But I find encoding category theory in HOL tedious, compared with doing it in dependent type theory, so I'm a little loath to pursue that route. [Plus I can only read Isabelle/HOL right now, I've never written any!]</p>",

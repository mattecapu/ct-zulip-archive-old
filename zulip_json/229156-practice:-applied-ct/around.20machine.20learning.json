A core problem for any predictive model fitted to data is to estimate how well it will do on future data. We generically expect it will do worse: the predictive error on the training data will be optimistically biased because the fitting procedure is trying to minimize that error! So the question is how to estimate the gap between the expected future error and empirical error. When people talk about theoretical understanding of predictive models, part of what they mean is having provable control over this gap under some set of assumptions.</p>\n<p>There are several major theoretical approaches to this problem. The classical approach relies on distributional assumptions or asymptotics: you either assume a tractable distribution, most often the Gaussian, or use asympotics such as the CLT to get one, and then make explicit calculations. When it works, this approach is excellent because it produces tight bounds. However, it does not scale easily to complex models and methods, although there is interesting recent work on asympotics in high-dimensional regimes.</p>\n<p>Computational learning theory is centered around newer approaches that are non-asymptotic in that they produce finite-sample bounds on the generalization gap. The key mathematical tool is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_measure\">concentration of measure</a> in high-dimensional space. The resulting bounds are usually too loose to be practically useful (e.g., for producing well-calibrated prediction intervals) but the theory is more general and easily applied to complex models than asympotics. That being said, we seem to be very far from being able to analyze realistic deep learning models using these techniques, hence the often heard complaint that the practice of deep learning has far outpaced the theory.</p>",

I'm mostly self-taught so maybe may mix up some concepts but in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05524\">this</a> paper a definition of commutativity up-to epsilon in a metric-enrcihed category is given.This got me to thinking - what would happen if we used a ML objective function instead of strict equality of morphisms and then would be able to optimize whole diagrams of networks instead of a single network? Also, there's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3608\">this</a> paper where an abstract definition of a measure of information of a morphism is given,which could be used in unsupervised learning when we have no labeled data.</p>\n<p>As for the current trend of self-supervision in ML (which is basically and visually as far as i understand it the idea of taking some pixels away out of an image and trying to predict them based on what's left) - i have this idea of an agent-environment adjunction where the categories in play are the states of the agent (resp. environment) and the self-supervised way of learning is learning the free-forgetful adjunction between them.In unsupervised inpainting  (predicting the left out pixels) for example the category of the environemnt would be the set of images,the agent category would be a subcategory of some category which starts out as just obejcts for each pixel with morphisms from a terminal object which lets us formalise that in this state (sbcategory) we are looking at this image,and then we learn (or 'grow') the subcategory by some algorithms by optimizing the forgetful (in this case it forgets the pixels)-free (most general guess from the given data) adjunction.For example,going by the intuition given in the categorical manifesto,limits are solution sets so from the ML perspective they are an abstraction of sort-of generative models (they model the probability the distribution p(X1,..,XN|Z) where Xi are objects in the base of the limit) and colimits are discriminative models (p(Z|X1,...,XN) where Z is the apex),but from an ML perspective all the limits and colimits can be seen as kernels as in a convolutional neural network for example.We go over the objects in th state of the agent that we have and and add an object by creating it from optimizing a (co)limit.</p>\n<p>Since this is already long I'm gonna finish by saying that I loved the \"Learners' Languages\" paper of Spivak - categorical logic in my view could be used as a tool in ML interpretability/explainability and also in a generative (In the ML case) way by constraining whats sort of structure we want to learn/generate,basically conditioning the network (category) of  networks or (whatever ML model we want).Also,I have an inkling feeling that there's some connection between the attention mechanism of transformers and lenses,since the attention mechanism 'queries' some 'data' and there's already a connection between lenses and databases as was said in this topic.</p>",

That is a very helpful thesis, just at the right level for me to understand. I was looking at traditional Machine Learning examples as implemented in the <a href=\"https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/\">Weka Java library</a> using algorithms described in the book <a href=\"https://books.google.de/books?id=1SylCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques</a>. The thesis by Bruno is looking more at Neural Network learning, but it is interesting to see the relationships.</p>\n<p>An example I was looking at was a <a href=\"https://old.openml.org/r/100241\">ML Run 100241 saved in the OpenML</a> which was described carefully in  <a href=\"http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/73039_9946de135c0a49daa7a0a9eda4a67a72.html\">Analysis of Credit Approval Data</a> and for which there is an interesting improvement showing how careful one has to be to clean the data used in: <a href=\"https://rpubs.com/JMarcos_87/730835\">Credit Screening Project</a>. This uses Logistic Regression (as <a href=\"https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.stable-3-8/weka/classifiers/functions/Logistic.html\">implemented in Java</a>) to give a probabilistic value on credit-worthiness.  The original data was anonymised, but the first article above managed to decrypt them to something meaningful, making the exercise more interesting. The data consists of what I think the thesis would consider a vector space of 16 dimensions</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>&#39;data.frame&#39;:   689 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ Male          : num  1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ...\n $ Age           : chr  &quot;58.67&quot; &quot;24.50&quot; &quot;27.83&quot; &quot;20.17&quot; ...\n $ Debt          : num  4.46 0.5 1.54 5.62 4 ...\n $ Married       : chr  &quot;u&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;u&quot; ...\n $ BankCustomer  : chr  &quot;g&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;g&quot; ...\n $ EducationLevel: chr  &quot;q&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;w&quot; ...\n $ Ethnicity     : chr  &quot;h&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;v&quot; ...\n $ YearsEmployed : num  3.04 1.5 3.75 1.71 2.5 ...\n $ PriorDefault  : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ...\n $ Employed      : num  1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ CreditScore   : num  6 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ DriversLicense: chr  &quot;f&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;f&quot; ...\n $ Citizen       : chr  &quot;g&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;s&quot; ...\n $ ZipCode       : chr  &quot;00043&quot; &quot;00280&quot; &quot;00100&quot; &quot;00120&quot; ...\n $ Income        : num  560 824 3 0 0 ...\n $ Approved      : chr  &quot;+&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;+&quot; ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If one were to model this as the thesis does one would have a functor from the free category from the single arrow graph <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">In \\to R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">I</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span> to the category of Euclidian Vector spaces with I guess <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">In</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">I</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span> mapped to the first 15 values and  <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span> mapped to a single Real Number corresponding to <code>Approved</code> since linear regression gives a probability value.</p>\n<p>Thinking about that the MSC model does seem to fit the credit approval case too then. and it confirms the idea that a Model is a function (as picked out by a functor) But the MSc helps explain the importance of parameters and how they fit in (parameters are also used in the credit example). </p>\n<p>The functorial view I think allows the thesis to  compose ML Algorithms following work by Spivak and Fong... I am still not quite clear how much that is tied to neural networks and how far traditional ML fits the picture.</p>",

The \"abstract deadline\" (now hopefully clarified to \"title and abstract deadline\") also applies to both of them, and refers to a plea for the submission of <em>just</em> the title and a short (~ one-paragraph) abstract of the planned full submission. The idea is that reviewing duties can then be distributed among the Program Committee as soon as possible based on these short abstracts, leaving more time for reviewers to check the correctness of proofs etc.</p>\n<p>The title and abstract submission deadline is soon, at <time datetime=\"2022-05-10T11:59:00Z\">2022-05-09T23:59:00-12:00</time>, and the full submission deadline two days later at <time datetime=\"2022-05-12T11:59:00Z\">2022-05-11T23:59:00-12:00</time> .</p>",

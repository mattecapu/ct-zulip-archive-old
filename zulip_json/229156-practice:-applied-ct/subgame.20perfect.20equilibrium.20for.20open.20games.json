So what I was saying is that the counterfactual reasoning of the players in the sequential game (in its open game version) is not really different from the associated simultaneous game---if it were, the first player would consider the fact that they are playing first and that the other player will observe their move and adopt a subgame perfect equilibrium strategy. So, at the syntactic/type level, open games allow for a dependence on past moves, but this dependence does not matter semantically because the second player might as well have played simultaneously and the same equilibria would be found.</p>",

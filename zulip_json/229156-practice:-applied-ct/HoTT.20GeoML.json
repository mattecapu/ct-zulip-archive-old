In the same way that in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf</a> the authors calculated the homotopy groups of spheres using HoTT, I'm wondering if we could e.g. calculate some simpler thing about a real world structure for which GML exists (like a famous Church etc) using HoTT methods.  Any thoughts?</p>",

        "content": "<p>To elaborate, I know how to write individual shapes such as toruses in HoTT, and I have coordinate lists for shapes in the GeoML file format, such as toruses, Iâ€™m just not sure what to do to corresponding HoTT code when those shapes are found to e.g. intersect or touch.  Presumably, I should push them out or create suspensions or sewing or do other topological things, but I don't know what these would be.  I think there's probably a cool quick demo here (perhaps a 'functional pearl') if this can be worked out.</p>",

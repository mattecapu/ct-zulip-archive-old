When it comes to generating actual numbers for something nontrivial, debugging becomes a nightmare. It takes several minutes to do the plumbing necessary just to get the outer system to output information I can actually analyze.</p>\n<p>Something obvious only happened to occurr to me this week: there's nothing Poly can do that Set can't, really. A dynamical system is just a morphism? Great, it actually is just a morphism in Set also (albeit one that is a giant composition of functions). If you care about type safety, just write Haskell code and use Debug.trace when developing something.</p>\n<p>I'm asking this with love of course. I've been excited about the category and have loved working with it, but debugging it versus debugging a little matlab benchmark has caused some existential angst. \"Why is anyone even doing this? is it just a cute coincidence that if you take a subcategory of the yoneda embedding you preserve the ability to express dynamical systems? is this actually practical?\" etc.</p>",

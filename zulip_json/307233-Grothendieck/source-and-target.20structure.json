When you write down the condition that you get isomorphisms for these, it turns out though that the condition makes sense in terms of the source-and-target structure alone, without having to use the composition laws at all (nor even degeneracies). This is a strange fact, which should be understood.\"<br>\n--Grothendieck, in a letter to Professor Ronnie Brown (p. 26, <a href=\"https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf\">https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf</a> )</p>\n<p>I am wondering if the strange fact:</p>\n<p>\"source-and-target structure alone\"</p>\n<p>has been understood. For instance, does the \"source-and-target structure alone\" correspond to the theory of irreflexive directed multigraphs (see Lawvere and Schanuel's Conceptual Mathematics, p. 150)?</p>\n<p>thanking you,<br>\nposina</p>",

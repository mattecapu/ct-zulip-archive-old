(The danger to category theory at Macquarie would be someone leaving for greener pastures. Though let me be clear that I have no reason to think that is going to happen.)</p>",

I remember when Richard, for instance, started there. It was great to see fresh, younger people coming in then, and look where he is today. There will be more intense competition now, and there is no middle-career block of people that will be the next generation, unless recruitment can happen. </p>\n<p>But, fwiw, it's good to get some more concrete details.</p>",

        "content": "<p>THE FOLLOWING IS THE ABSTRACT OF A (draft) 70 PAGE RESEARCH REPORT, \"Microlectics, Mathematics, and Life.\"</p>\n<p>Microlectics is a specialized language - a \"microlect\" - for expressing an intuitive model of specialized languages for expressing intuitive models. The proposal is a mathematical theory  combining observation of \"real\" patterns with invention of \"imaginary\" patterns of chunks - things or beings, and overt (e.g., conscious thought) and covert (e.g., dance) behavioral-patterns of beings. It introduces a spectrum of microlects, from poetry to philosophy to mathematics to code, for expressing intuitive models in minds of beings. Intuitive models resonate more or less, and resonances are invoked by encounters between things and beings and between beings and beings. The mathematical tool is a multi-dimensional linguistic topos. The objects are situations and the morphisms are events with propensities defined by probability and time. Stories are chains of situations and events conforming to a pattern (of things) or behavioral pattern (of beings). The algebro-diagrammatic microlect of the linguistic topos is a framework for expressing Five Laws of Biology, including formalized statements of the meaning and purpose of Life. The result is a contribution to the mathematical philosophy of biology.</p>\n<p>behavior, being , encounter,  event, intuitive-model, intuitive-resonance,  Life,  linguistic topos, microlect, pattern, propensity, situation, thing</p>",

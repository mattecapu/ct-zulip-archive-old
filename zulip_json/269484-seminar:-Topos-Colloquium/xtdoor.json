Are your logical frameworks sufficiently expressive to encode the normalization algorithm of object-languages without needing to descend to Scala code again?  How does that work?  Most logical frameworks I've seen can encode the equality judgment of object-languages, or perhaps some small- or big-step operational semantics relation, but I never thought of being able to extract an actual implementation of a normalization algorithm from such an encoding without additional coding.</p>",

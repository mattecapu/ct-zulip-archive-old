We will begin with a brief review of operads and their representations with topological simplices and the real line as the main example. We then give a general definition for a derivation of an operad in any category with values in an abelian bimodule over the operad. The main result is that Shannon entropy defines a derivation of the operad of topological simplices, and that for every derivation of this operad there exists a point at which it is given by a constant multiple of Shannon entropy. We show this is compatible with, and relies heavily on, a well-known characterization of entropy given by Faddeev in 1956 and a recent variation given by Leinster.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_cAEfQQcELA\">https://youtu.be/_cAEfQQcELA</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"_cAEfQQcELA\" href=\"https://youtu.be/_cAEfQQcELA\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/c605c8950dfac2eb7a828b70930465db65ed47fd/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f5f63414566515163454c412f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

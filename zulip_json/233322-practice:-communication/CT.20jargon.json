In particular, I think that by virtue of CT being a \"metamathematics\", it interacts directly with many if not most other branches of mathematics, and in this interaction it picks up terms and adopts them as general concepts. The first examples that come to mind are limit, Hopf algebra, and groupoid. I'd like to hear other people's examples that fit this trend. But now that I'm thinking about it, it might actually be something like most terms in CT which started in other fields?</p>",

Maybe I am stretching the meaning of \"jargon\" but I think that recurring words/phrases with an informal but sort-of-standardized meaning should also qualify.  In a sense, they are even more insidious to a beginner/outsider.  For category theory, an example I am thinking of is \"yoga\".  I've heard it several times from category theorists, but never in any other field, so I would say that it is part of CT jargon, although maybe it's not common enough...  (I wonder who was the first to use it.  Grothendieck?  It is certainly in Récoltes and Semailles.  So maybe the use began in algebraic geometry and then stuck in category theory).</p>",

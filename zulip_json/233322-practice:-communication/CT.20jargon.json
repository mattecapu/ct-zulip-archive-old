In particular, I think that by virtue of CT being a \"metamathematics\", it interacts directly with many if not most other branches of mathematics, and in this interaction it picks up terms and adopts them as general concepts. The first examples that come to mind are limit, Hopf algebra, and groupoid. I'd like to hear other people's examples that fit this trend. But now that I'm thinking about it, it might actually be something like most terms in CT which started in other fields?</p>",

Historically, sheaves in topology were only of abelian groups, if I am not mistaken Grothendieck was the first to stress the importance of (pre)sheaves of bare sets, and this abstraction was possible thanks to category theory (and it was, at the same time, a crucial ingredient of the development of category theory itself: a big part of CT was developed to develop topos theory, which started as the study of categories of sheaves of sets).</p>",

This is obviously my experience too, but I am clearly biased. I looked at the submissions for this year's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some3\">SoME</a>, and there is only one video on CT, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some2\">last year's</a> had three.

That said, I don't know how much this translates into actual novel category theory content - for example because the amount of category theory one encounters when learning the main concepts of Haskell is fairly surface level. </p>\n<p>I would guess this is what we see reflected in the SoME submissions: it's more reflective of the proportion of people who work deeply enough with category theory that they have the depth of knowledge to make novel expository content as opposed to the proportion of people who have dipped their toes in category theory and are talking about it online.</p>",

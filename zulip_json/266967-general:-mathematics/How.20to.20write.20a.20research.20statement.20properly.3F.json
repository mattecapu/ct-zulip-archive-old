This depends in part on whether the advertisement says they're looking for a category theorist, or something more general.   There will often be a committee of several mathematicians working on different subjects, who read a lot of applications, and who may also show the applications to subject matter experts.   In this case I feel it helps to prove you can talk clearly to people outside your own subject.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was about to say something like that too: you should think a lot about the audience you're writing for.  E.g. I've been on hiring committees for tenure-track positions here at USD, which is a small teaching-focused school; in a case like that, the odds are that <em>no one</em> reading your research statement will know anything about your research area (and in my experience it's quite rare for applicants to appreciate just how ignorant of their field the audience is).  On the other hand, I've also been essentially a one-person hiring committee for a postdoc position funded by an external grant, and in a case like that you can be pretty sure that the audience knows at least as much about the field as you do.  And there's a lot of room in between those two extremes.</p>",

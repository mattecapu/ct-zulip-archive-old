Consider the set of states of the world corresponding to Earth plus its satellites. This set may be partitioned into two subsets: states where some physical systems have knowledge of Newton’s law5 (i.e., humans) and states where there is no such knowledge6. One example of the latter is Earth with one natural satellite – the Moon, which was the state of Earth in our history prior to 1957. It is entirely possible (and by that I mean allowed by the laws of physics) that Earth might have also had no Moon, two captured asteroids for Moons (as is the case for Mars) or a potential host of alternative smallish rocky bodies orbiting it. All are equally viable states of the world consistent with known physics. It is also entirely possible (again I mean allowed by the laws of physics) that Earth have any number of artificial satellites or space junk. However, the latter set of states, while possible, is not accessible (by this I mean not encoded in the initial conditions) without human or human-­‐like technology. Thus, when comparing the size of the state space of Earth plus satellites, the state space is much larger if artificial satellites are included, i.e., if laws of gravitation are known. Thus when considering the number of states of the world consisting of Earth plus satellites, very many more states are potentially accessible from states of the world in which some physical systems have knowledge of the laws of gravitation than from a node where there is no such information. Thus, in a network of all possible states of the world, nodes with knowledge of Newton’s law are more highly connected to other nodes within the space of all possible configurations of Earth plus satellites.\"</p>",

I think because mathematics is now divided into pure and applied, the meaning part is lost, although I think since mathematics concern the highest universality of human practices, the loss of meanings ends up putting up barricades on places where new development can happens. </p>\n<p>My understanding now is that Rovelli's saying the world is not made of particles and reversible dynamical laws of the particles, it's made of relations between possible events, and events as some change that happens that may or may not be measured e.g. entanglement, therefore he puts uncertainty principle, irreversibility, non-equilibrium conditions, information loss from measurement at the centre of physics. The relation between events i.e. constraints is where complexity of an organism lies, which allows the organism to circumvent the dynamics causally, while the dynamics can be quite simple e.g. second law of thermodynamics. This is likewise the case of the inconsistency relations that Winkle is talking about, that the relation between uncertain environment and computer program(s), and between program and program(s). Same phenomena happen in complex system works such as Walker e.g. relation between satellites and Barrett  e.g. relation between mental phenomena and physical phenomena. The relations are to be contrasted to functions of certitude and reversibility. Same phenomena happen in philosophy works such as James on pragmatic theory of Truth i.e. it's the value that's evolving towards higher complexity. Likewise in social sciences that has pragmatic orientations, such as those of Parsons.</p>",

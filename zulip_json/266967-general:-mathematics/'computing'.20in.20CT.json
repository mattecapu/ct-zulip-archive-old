I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only \"in\" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called \"using\" CT than \"in\" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo \"in\" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>",

Because making mathematics understanble by computers is equal to making mathematics better, both for humans and computers. I know an example where such a thing happened. There is a field in algebraic topology which is named Functor calculus, or Goodwillie calculus. It is named calculus because it looks like calculus but it is clearly not the same thing. Investigation in computer science led to linear logic, twenty years later, differential linear logic was invented, then differential categories, then cartesian differential categories and then in 2018, in this paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01930\">Directional derivatives and higher order chain rules for abelian functor calculus</a> they found that functor calculus gives an example of cartesian differential category.</p>\n<p>So, here progress in pure mathematics came from research in logic and an aera of logic which is tightely linked with the theory of programming languages. So, please, yes people were doing computations before computers exist, but what computers are doing is closer to what computation is really: a completely mechanical process. So it is the computers which are really doing computations. And helping them to do these computations, is a good thing for everybody.

I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only \"in\" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called \"using\" CT than \"in\" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo \"in\" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>",

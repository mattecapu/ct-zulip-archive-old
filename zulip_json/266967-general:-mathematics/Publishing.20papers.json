Different journals have different standards.  To tell if something is publishable in Journal X, you need to look at a bunch of articles in Journal X.     The only shortcut is to have an advisor who knows your work and has read Journal X.   But even if you do have such an advisor, it's good to do this sort of reading yourself, where you look at journals just to see what they're like - not to understand the papers in detail, but just to see what it takes to publish a paper there.</p>",

You don't always want to aim for the Minimum Publishable Unit.</p>\n<p>My default approach is to work on a subject until I'm done working on it for now, and then figure out how to make zero or more publishable papers out of what I've got.  Depending on the situation, \"done working on it for now\" might mean that I've proven everything I wanted to prove; or it might mean I've proven <em>something</em> and I wish I could prove more, but I'm out of ideas or time for working on it more right now.  For instance, the latter is how I ended up writing four papers about the semantics of HoTT in higher toposes: each time I came back to it with a new idea and pushed it as far as I could at that time, even though the first three times that wasn't as far as I wanted.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes it happens that I'm not done working on a project yet, but I reach a point where I have a pretty good guess that <em>eventually</em> I'll want to split it up into multiple papers, and I can tell that the material that'll go in one of those papers is basically complete.  This is a bit dangerous because writing up and publishing that paper tends to distract me from actually continuing to work on the project, and so it takes longer to finish the other papers (if I indeed ever do).  For instance, my work on LNL polycategories was originally intended to prove a 2-conservativity result for them, but developing the basic theory got so long that I published a paper about just that -- and I still haven't gone back to finish the 2-conservativity.</p>",

        "content": "<p>As for how I would split a project up into papers when it's finished, there are a lot of considerations.  Usually my default approach is to start trying to write it as one paper, and see whether it starts collapsing under its own weight or trying to break itself in half, and if so whether there are parts it could be divided into that can stand on their own.  Another thing to think about is whether different parts of the work are of interest to different communities and might benefit from being published in different venues, or at least unencumbered by other parts of the project that some readers might be intimidated or bored by.</p>\n<p>For instance, right now I'm working on a theorem about semantics of modal dependent type theory.  I have a pretty satisfying result about semantics in diagrams of 1-categories, and a less complete result about diagrams of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span></span></span></span>-categories, and I've been going back and forth about whether to put them in one paper or two.  At the moment, I'm leaning towards publishing the 1-categorical version on its own, because it's more complete, doesn't require homotopy-theoretic background to read, and will probably be of interest to a wider audience.  Then I'd take some more time to see whether I can get a better result in the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span></span></span></span>-case before deciding to cut off that work and publish it.

If it's a substantial amount of work, it can be its own paper. Sometimes perhaps one is in the position Mike was in, but where the paper with the partial results weren't yet submitted, and then with a chunk more work, it turns out a complete story could be told. In that case it might be reasonable to update the arXiv paper, but definitely noting in the metadata that this is the case. The situation where this makes the most sense is where the additional work gives a stronger result, but which on its own seems like an incremental addition (regardless of how much effort went into finding the new resut).</p>\n<p>For example, my first solo paper, post-PhD in TAC is different to how it was when I first submitted it, because in the very slow revision processes (I left academia temporarily, and other life stuff happened), I managed to make the results more general. So I updated the arXiv version, and the updated version back to the journal, upon which the referee was I think rather gracious in reading over a heavily-revised article (though the generalisation wouldn't have really been worth a sequel on its own, it just rewrote the main results in a way that was more general). I had to, at one point, cut this revision off, since I was in danger of writing a legitimately new paper, rather than merely strenthening  the existing one.</p>",

The point is that I'm already not heavily excited by the idea to get a postdoc later and then maybe accumulating several ones before finally abandoning doing math in academia because I don't find a stable position. Several past or potential relationship have already told me implicitly or explicitly that they changed their mind and don't want to stay with me or simply don't want to start if they don't know where and when I will have a normal job like people outside academia. Anyway I think I should continue because I would probably be really bad in another occupation than doing a phd in math today.

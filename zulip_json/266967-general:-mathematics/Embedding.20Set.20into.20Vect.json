Here's one of many possible entry points.</p>\n<p>Sets and vector spaces are two of the most useful structures in mathematics.   But in a certain sense we can embed set theory into linear algebra!   For any set there's a vector space with that set as basis.  And any function between sets gives a linear map between their vector spaces, sending basis vectors to basis vectors.  </p>\n<p>But can we find set theory lurking in linear algebra?  That is, starting from the category of vector spaces, can we recognize the category of sets embedded in it?</p>\n<p>Yes we can!  I explain how here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/06/grothendieckgaloisbrauer_theor.html\">Grothendieck-Galois-Brauer Theory (Part 1)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The free vector space on a set acquires extra structure from having come from a set (that is, having a chosen basis): it's a 'cocommutative coseparable algebra', which is a gadget I define.   And I have a conjecture:</p>\n<p><strong>Conjecture 3.</strong> The category of cocommutative coseparable coalgebras in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">V</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">c</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">t</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">C</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathsf{Vect}_{\\mathbb{C}}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">Vect</span></span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3322em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathbb mtight\">C</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">â€‹</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and coalgebra homomorphisms between these, is equivalent to the category of sets and functions.</p>\n<p>But so far the only proof I know relies on a bunch of results including an offhand remark without proof in the first paper on coseparable coalgebras.   There should be a better proof, with all the details filled in.</p>",

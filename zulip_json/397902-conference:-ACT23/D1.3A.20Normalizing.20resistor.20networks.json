See the start of Section 3.3 here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>John Baez and Brendan Fong, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625\">A compositional framework for passive linear networks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be nice to have a category in which circuits are morphisms, and a category in which Dirichlet forms are morphisms, such that the map sending a circuit to its behavior is a functor. Here we present a naive attempt to construct the category with Dirichlet forms as morphisms, using the principle of minimum power to compose these morphisms. There is a hitch: the proposed category does not include identity morphisms. However, our construction points in the right direction, and underlines the importance of the cospan formalism we develop in the next Part II.</p>\n</blockquote>",

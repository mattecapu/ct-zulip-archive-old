Notably, all Smithsonian museums in DC are entirely free, although a few may require advance ticket reservations. Additionally, the area offers a wide array of captivating places and restaurants to discover. We strongly encourage participants to self-organize into small groups for their explorations. Please refer to the information provided regarding local travel concerns.</p>",

So, for instance, where there is plenty of ACT work looking to capture causal relations in causal network, there is also decades of work in philosophy on causality, e.g., discussion on different conceptions in Regularity theory, Probabilistic theory, Counterfactual theory, Interventionist theory, Process theory,... The idea then is for some mutually beneficial exchange, where philosophy gains by taking on a powerful formalism. Anyone interested in such a network?</p>",

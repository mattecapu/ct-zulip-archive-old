I'm unsure exactly how he sees ontology, it seems somewhere in between Heidegger and Spivak. I lean heavily towards Spivak, i.e. that categories are ontologies (<a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf\">ologs</a>). In my view, <em>any</em> structured collection of things form an ontology. So categories, but also spaces, groups, sSets, etc. In this sense, I naively agree with the notion that \"mathematics = ontology\". Again, I'm not actually sure this is how Badiou sees ontology, and to be perfectly transparent I have not yet finished the book.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the goal of HoTT, and other modern foundations, is to ontologize mathematics: Turning the nebulous \"proof statements\" of math, into <em>things</em> (objects, like spaces) inside of ontologies (higher/formal categories). </p>\n<p>In this sense, would you agree or disagree with the statement that \"Ontology = Mathematics\" or even \"Ontology <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>≃</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\simeq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4637em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≃</span></span></span></span> Mathematics\"?</p>",

HoTT has an interesting semantics for proofs, whereas ZFC does not have a really interesting semantics for proofs besides the tautological one (a proof is a well formed syntax tree). Old school intuitionism has a nebulous proof semantics - a proof is a mental construction, a proof is a piece of evidence that witnesses the validity of a proposition. Modern constructive type theories allow us to make the old school intuitionist proof semantics more precise/rigorous.</p>\n<p>I don't know if I'm missing something here, but maybe you can clarify how your concept of ontologizing mathematics ties into the research program of proof-theoretic semantics?

I think many people have written about this as n-theories, where the n+1-theory is seen as a sort of \"doctrine\" for the kinds of n-theories within it.  An ontology, as a structured collection of things, reasons about its entities using its structure. For example, a LCCC provides the structure for expressing dependent products and sums. In this sense, the category of LCCCs is an ontology (like a 2-theory), a specific LCCC is an ontology (like a 1-theory), and ostensibly the objects of an LCCC are ontologies, though this requires extra work.   As a more simple example: a group is an ontology, the monoidal category of groups is an ontology, the 2-category of monoidal categories is an ontology, and so on. Ontologies all the way down. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>second, why should the sort of mathematical objects you point to be identified as 'ontologies'?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my view, any mathematical object should be considered as an ontology. If in philosophy \"ontology\" means a theory of existence, \"an ontology\", as I have defined it, is a collection of things that exist. For example, an element of a group exists within the group itself.

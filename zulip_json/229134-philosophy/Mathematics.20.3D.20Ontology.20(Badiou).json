I seem to have a similar view of the world, however I consider myself mathematics first, philosophy second (or third, after physics). </p>\n<p>His thesis is that ontology = mathematics. I'm unsure exactly how he sees ontology, it seems somewhere in between Heidegger and Spivak. I lean heavily towards Spivak, i.e. that categories are ontologies (<a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf\">ologs</a>). In my view, <em>any</em> structured collection of things form an ontology. So categories, but also spaces, groups, sSets, etc. In this sense, I naively agree with the notion that \"mathematics = ontology\". Again, I'm not actually sure this is how Badiou sees ontology, and to be perfectly transparent I have not yet finished the book.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the goal of HoTT, and other modern foundations, is to ontologize mathematics: Turning the nebulous \"proof statements\" of math, into <em>things</em> (objects, like spaces) inside of ontologies (higher/formal categories). </p>\n<p>In this sense, would you agree or disagree with the statement that \"Ontology = Mathematics\" or even \"Ontology <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>≃</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\simeq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4637em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≃</span></span></span></span> Mathematics\"?</p>",

CT does it too; I love virtual double categories, yet it is not the perfect \"synthetic\" structure to describe many ideas.  vdcs help to frame the yet-to-be-discovered, more expressive structures. I think if I am groping for higher math to help me, he should be able to do it too, to an extent. e.g. he shouldn't be able to print mis-information.</p>\n<p>Anyway,  in my view, the notion of \"choice of structure\" needs to be taken seriously in a good theory of ontology.</p>",

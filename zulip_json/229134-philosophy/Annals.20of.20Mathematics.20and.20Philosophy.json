        "content": "<p>There is a new journal about philosophy of mathematics: <a href=\"https://mxphi.com\">Annals of Mathematics and Philosophy</a>.  So I want to advertise it in case you're interested by the subject and if you didn't notice. The first issue is available in open access here: <a href=\"https://mxphi.com/first-issue/\">Volume 1, number 1, 2023</a>. Every single paper looks passionating, I think I'm going to read all of them! For example, three of them are titled \"What makes mathematicians believe unproved mathematical statements?\" by Timothy Gowers, a paper \"Ways of thinking in mathematics\" (Javier de Lorenzo), \"What is axiomatics?\" (Paolo Cant√π). There is an interview of Penrose also and the other ones are attracting to me too.</p>",

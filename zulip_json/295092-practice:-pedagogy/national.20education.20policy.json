What resources would you suggest? Is <em>Conceptual Mathematics</em> a good resource for Posina et al. to have selected, in your opinion?</p>",

Both proofs and exploration went hand in hand as we studied a bit of number theory and combinatorics.</p>\n<p>I believe teaching category theory would be a great opportunity to include abstract reasoning in the curriculum, but I see alternatives such as abstract algebra and order theory. Unfortunately, I am not really familiar with how children and teenagers learn to compare them meaningfully.</p>\n<p>I like the book (or the parts I have read), but I would suggest improving it with the advice of pedagogy experts and some in-class experiments instead of simply translating it.</p>",

Here's my to-do list now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Finish \"Structured versus decorated cospans\" with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276972\">@Kenny</span>  and @<strong>Christina V</strong> .    Submitted to the arXiv and <em>Transactions of the AMS</em>, but Kenny and I are still writing up all details of the proofs of two theorems, which involve lots of big commutative diagrams.  We're meeting once a week on Mondays at 11 to work on that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Submit LaTeX of \"Open systems in classical mechanics\" to <em>Journal of Mathematical Physics</em>, who accepted this paper with David Weisbart and Adam Yassine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work on \"Schur functors\" with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275914\">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277611\">@Todd Trimble</span>.  Stalled, but soon to be revived.   It's about 3/4 done.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare a talk for Friday  February 5, 2021 on \"Structured versus Decorated Cospans\" for the Yorkshire and Midlands Category Seminar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare a talk for Monday March 8, 2021 at the Zurich Theoretical Physics Colloquium, perhaps called \"Theoretical Physics in the 21st Century\", as part of their Sustainability Week.    The idea is to talk about the most exciting areas in physics... but with an emphasis on what physicists can do to save the planet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare a talk  for Thursday March 18, 2021 for the Topos Institute seminar.   Maybe something similar to 4. but with applied category theory instead of physics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare a talk on octonions and the Standard Model for Kirill Krasnov's workshop on this seminar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write an article on condensed matter physics for <em>Nautilus</em> magazine.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

In trying to understand it better, I am led to the following vague question:</p>\n<p>There is a sort of duality between locally connected geometric morphisms and tidy geometric morphisms -- the former are the stable left Beck-Chevalley geometric morphisms (Elephant C 3.3.16) while the latter are the stable right Beck-Chevalley geometric morphisms (C 3.4.11). Does this analogy include some class of geometric morphisms which stands in relation to the tidy geometric morphisms just as connected geometric morphisms stand in relation to locally connected geometric morphisms?</p>",

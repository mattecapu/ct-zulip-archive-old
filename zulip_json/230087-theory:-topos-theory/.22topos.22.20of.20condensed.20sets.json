Given a site (C, J),  we have the category of small presheaves on C and the category of small J-sheaves on C; assuming J is subcanonical, we get a colimit-preserving functor from presheaves to sheaves. Is it always a localisation? Does it always have a right adjoint? I know there are combinatorial hypotheses that ensure the functor is lex.</p>",

I don't see what's unsatisfactory about it; if the category doesn't have a small generating set, then there's no reason there would be any other possibility, and in any case the pretopos itself is certainly a more canonical choice of site than anything smaller.</p>",

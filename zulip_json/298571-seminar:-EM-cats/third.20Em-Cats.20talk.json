        "content": "<p><strong>Johan García Vargas (Universidad de los Andes)</strong>: <em>Galois theory and Hopf monads</em></p>\n<p>Galois theory is essentially about using symmetry for classifying structure. In Artin's formulation, the fundamental theorem is a correspondence between subgroups of the Galois group and intermediate fields. It is given by invariants and stabilisers: a subgroup corresponds to the field of elements fixed by it, its invariants; conversely, an intermediate field corresponds to the subgroup of symmetries that leave it fixed, its stabilizer. Galois theory is not particular to fields nor algebra, analogous phenomena has been observed in logic, geometry and even physics.</p>\n<p>Grothendieck provides a more abstract formulation: now we study a set valued functor, looking at it as a structure, and relate it to the actions of its symmetry group. So we have axioms on the functor ensuring that its domain category is equivalent to the category of those actions. It is well-established that by considering transitive actions we can recover Artin's formulation from Grothendieck's one.</p>\n<p>The Tannakian formalism was developed in analogy with Grothendieck's, replacing group actions by Hopf algebra representations. Noticing that both of these can be expressed as algebras for a Hopf monad, Bruguières managed to put this analogy on formal ground. Regarding the Hopf monad approach as a \"Tannakian-Grothendieck\" formulation, our work aims to recover a \"Tannakian-Artin\" formulation. We generalise the definitions of invariants and stabilisers to the setting of Hopf monads, and establish a naturally-arising generalisation of Artin's correspondence to this setting. In particular, this enables us to transfer the fundamental theorem of Galois theory from groups to quantum groups.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Nuiok Dicaire</strong>: <em>Localisable monads, from global to local</em></p>\n<p>Monads have many useful applications. In mathematics they are used to study algebras at the level of theories rather than specific structures. In programming languages, monads provide a convenient way to handle computational side-effects which include, roughly speaking, things like interacting with external code or altering the state of the program's variables. An important question is then how to handle several instances of such side-effects or a graded collection of them. The general approach consists in defining many “small” monads and combining them together using distributive laws.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we take a different approach and look for a pre-existing internal structure to a monoidal category that allows us to develop a fine-graining of monads. This uses techniques from tensor topology and provides an intrinsic theory of local computational effects without needing to know how the constituent effects interact beforehand. We call the monads obtained \"localisable\" and show how they are equivalent to monads in a specific 2-category. To motivate the talk, we will consider two concrete applications in concurrency and quantum theory. This is all covered in our recent paper: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01756\">arxiv.org/abs/2108.01756</a>.</p>",

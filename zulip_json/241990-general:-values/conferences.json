I got into topos theory as a masters student by going to a topos theory school in Nice. There was no funding for this; I got cheap flights and a cheap airbnb to participate. Most people would not have that opportunity. It is great that many academics get generous travel funding, but that's never going to be true of everyone that could benefit from participation in our events and conferences.</p>",

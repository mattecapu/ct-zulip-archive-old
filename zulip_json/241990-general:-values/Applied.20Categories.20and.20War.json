And I don't think smart bombs can overcome physics. A bunker buster is always going to cause a lot of damage, regardless of how accurate and precise it is. It also depends on a willingness to use them surgically. For instance, the current war in Ukraine shows both extremes: The Ukrainians, with their HIMARS have shown the capability to do surgical strikes on ammo depots and command centers, while on the opposite extreme, the Russian military has shown a willingness to use their advanced weapons on civilian infrastructure and on residential targets.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"428716\">Jean-Baptiste Vienney</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct/topic/Applied.20Categories.20and.20War/near/342486273\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions.

I was going to continue and say that if category theorists help the military with specific projects like CASCADE they will be helping develop specifically <em>military</em> applications of category theory.

It can <br>\ncause untold amounts of suffering - or good.  Research in these areas can inadvertently cause immense suffering.   There is an arms race between nations in all areas of science, technology and mathematics.</p>\n<p>Category theory is part of this, and I don't think it can be cleanly separated out.   That is, if everyone doing category theory quit now, the effects would be rather subtle.    As people never tire of telling category theorists, almost anything you can do with category theory can also be done without it.  The difference is mainly that with category theory it's gets done in a clearer, more generalizable and less error-prone way.</p>",

You might glue interfaces and maybe constrain actuators. Now you're making a simplicial set. There might be some function over local groups of gizmos. Now you have a local section in a sheaf. You might want to engineer a behavior under an ensemble of environmental conditions. Now you're doing statistical physics.

When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk.

Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious \"gray matter\", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming \"helplessness\" or \"personal insecurity\" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate \"passively\" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on \"pure\" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the \"military manna\" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>",

Thus  even  if  scientists  accept  massive  amounts  from  the military, it will not diminish –even by one –the number of weapons the army has at its disposal, nor the number of victims massacred by this same army when it is engaged in a  war,  as  is  actually  the  case  in  the  USA <br>\n[...]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The support of pure scientific research lends a degree of respectability and even an aura  of  innocence  to  the  army.    How  can  one  hope  that  the  man-in-the-street  or  the politician  will  wake  up  to  these  ignoble  escapades  that  might  prove  fatal  to  all  of  us, when he sees the entire scientific community collaborating with the very apparatus that poses these threats?<br>\n[...]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Certainly  research  is  an  agreeable  activity  for  those  who  engage  in  it, sometimes   even   exalting.      That   doesn't   establish   its   utility,   or   that   its   positive consequences,  outweigh  the  negative  ones.    Too  often  it  has  served  the  vilification  of man,  from  the  beginning  of  the  industrial  revolution  until  today,  when  it  may  well prove  to  be  the  tool  of  its  own  final  destruction.    In  fact  the  men  whose  activities  have been  the  most  dangerous  and  deadly  for  humanity  over  the  past  thirty  years  are  not heads  of  state,  nor  generals,  but  scientists –for  without  them,  the  military  would  have remained  relatively  inoffensive. From  this  global  perspective,  I  am  convinced  that  no scientific  discovery,  however  useful  it  may  appear  to  be,  can  compensate  for  or  justify the collaboration of a scientist with the military.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",

Many people writing here wouldn't have been in academia at all.  Not gonna start naming people but from what I know that's surely 50+ and probably 100+ at least, several in this conversation.  You want them all to vanish like in the Avengers?  Just klick your fingers then, I'll provide you with their names.  The fact that there is now this flourishing ACT community, as well as QPL, quantum foundations etc.  wouldn't have happened without that. If you are not mainstream, you have to seek alternative resources.   The reality is that with the exception of some CS places in Europe, CT was dying 20 years ago, big centres were evaporating.   I was unemployed, since the CT community driven by utopian sofa ideology had not taken care at all of its offspring, being just busy with person cults. The end of the species was looming.  I spend a major chunk of the past 20 years, and continuing to do so now, to generate jobs for enabling people to do interesting things.   We build a group through which some 300 people came trough, now having their own groups elsewhere.  You want them all to vanish?  I can give the names.  Tell them.  \"When we take money, we endorse the people from whom we take money\", yeah right, and the military is going to get more money because of some category theoretician respecting them, right.  What I have seen instead  is that people who helped us are doing so because they believe in good science and have a hell of a job trying to justify that to their admirals.  I have seen some of those loose their jobs cause they gave money to people like me; I have a lot more respect for them than for sofa ideologists who don't bother to help with the procreation of their community.

I think one of the differences that people are not paying attention to is that in Europe there are, besides individual countries' NSF-like funders such as EPSRC, the EU, and their frameworks. While in the USA there's this pretense of commercial innovation, but actually the infrastructure work has always been paid by the military:  the silicon chips, the internet,  even the GPU revolution (that we tend to say came about because of the porn -- and the games) was originally supported by the military. I understand that when we accept their money, we give them some credibility that I wish I didn't have to give. But I also think that the money they spent on CT is a dent in the money they spent on killing robots and other technologies much more clearly lethal.

Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious \"gray matter\", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming \"helplessness\" or \"personal insecurity\" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate \"passively\" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on \"pure\" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the \"military manna\" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>I respect this POV but strongly disagree with the idea that military R&amp;D is a bad thing in its own right, to say nothing of my belief that it is by far the greatest catalyst for technological development\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

As usual, I'm not secretly trying to make some point: when I want to make a point I try to make it directly.  I just think it's good to know the history.  \"Willingness to collaborate with the military\" is a somewhat odd way to describe what Einstein did.</p>\n<p>Briefly: during WWII the physicist Leo Szilard spent a lot of time sitting in his bathtub pondering nuclear fission, which had been discovered by the German chemist Hahn and the German Jewish physicist Lise Meitner in 1938.</p>\n<p>He realized that it could be used to make a bomb - which may sound obvious, but is not really: it's not trivial to build a nuclear weapon.   He realized that the Nazis would try to do this - which turned out to be true: the Nazi bomb project was led by Heisenberg.    And he decided that the US had to build its own bomb, or at least look into whether it was really possible.</p>\n<p>So he decided to write a letter to president Roosevelt advocating this.  But he knew Roosevelt wouldn't listen to him, so he decide to enlist the help of the most famous physicist in the world, the only one whose letter Roosevelt might read: Einstein.</p>\n<p>And so they wrote a letter to Roosevelt, and after a while Roosevelt started the Manhattan Project.</p>\n<p>Einstein wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project at all... except for starting it, which of course is huge: I'm not trying to minimize that!</p>",

Roosevelt,<br>\nPresident of the United States,<br>\nWhite House<br>\nWashington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Sir:</p>\n<p>Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:</p>\n<p>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</p>\n<p>The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.</p>\n<p>In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:</p>\n<p>a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.</p>\n<p>b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.</p>\n<p>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.</p>\n<p>Yours very truly,</p>\n<p>Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>",

The question is whether knowing this fact, was crucial for developing atomic bombs.  And I don't think so!   What was really crucial was research on radioactivity and later nuclear physics, and Einstein didn't do any of this, as far as I know.</p>\n<p>If you want to blame someone, blame:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pierre Becquerel for discovering radioactivity: \"By May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marie and Pierre Curie for discovering and studying new radioactive elements like radium and polonium ; they shared the 1903 Nobel with Becquerel for work on radioactivity.  Marie died of cancer from doing experiments with these materials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ernest Rutherford for inventing the concept of half-life, and discovering that in radioactive decay one element would turn into another by emitting alpha and beta particles.  In 1917 Rutherford carried out the first \"nuclear reaction\": bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles and turning it into oxygen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Otto Hahn for discovering nuclear fission in 1938 and Lise Meitner for figuring out what was going on: a nucleus of uranium bombarded with neutrons could split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy and also more neutrons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frédéric Joliot-Curie, the husband of Marie and Pierre's daughter, for letting the world know that this could create a chain reaction.   Leo Szilard actually came up with the idea in 1933, and in 1934 he patented the idea of a nuclear reactor.  But he was smart enough to keep quiet about it.   When Enrico Fermi (in New York) and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (in Paris) started doing experiments on nuclear fission, he tried to persuade them to not publish anything about the idea of a chain reaction, lest the Nazis become aware of it.    Fermi agreed to self-censor.   Joliot-Curie did not: he published an article in <em>Nature</em> saying that when a uranium atom split, it released more neutrons that it took to split that uranium atom!   The idea of a nuclear bomb was then apparent to any intelligent physicist.  Leo Szilard became so scared of the Nazis developing a bomb that in 1938 he decided to contact Roosevelt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Werner Heisenberg for agreeing to lead the Nazi atomic bomb project.   He later argued that he deliberately <em>slowed down</em> this project, and there's even some evidence for this, but people will argue endlessly about it, and Bohr broke off his friendship with Heisenberg over this issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fermi, Bohr and all the other physicists who joined the Manhattan Project - this is a very long list.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Einstein was a bit player in all this <em>except</em> that he went along with Szilard and wrote the letter to Roosevelt.   </p>\n<p>The myth that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">E = mc^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">m</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">c</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> was the key to the atomic bomb came later.

When people crossed a street, their feet stuck in the melted asphalt; they tried to extricate themselves with their hands, only to find them stuck as well. They remained on all fours screaming. Small children lay like \"fried eels\" on the pavement. The firestorm sucked all the oxygen out of the city.</em> - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Hamburg_(book)\">Martin Middlebrook</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground\">firebombing of Dresden in February 1945</a>, where they - or should I say \"we\"? - dropped 3,900 tons of bombs and incendiary devices on the city, leading to a firestorm that killed about 25,000 people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere, everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.</em> — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground\">Lothar Metzger, survivor</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then came the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo\">bombing of Tokyo in March 1945</a>.   279 planes flew over the city and dropped 1,665 tons of bombs. Most were 500-pound cluster bombs, each one releasing 38 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of about 2000 feet. These bomblets punched through the roofs of people's houses or landed on the ground and ignited 3.5 seconds later, throwing out jets of flaming, sticky napalm.  Tokyo was a densely packed city, largely made of <em>paper</em>.</p>\n<p>The planes also dropped 100-pound jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bombs that ignited upon impact. The city's fire departments were overwhelmed, and the individual fires started by the bombs joined to create a huge conflagration that destroyed 16 square miles of the city. Over 100,000 people died — nobody knows how many, and both the Japanese and Americans had reasons to underestimate the casualties. </p>\n<p><a href=\"user_uploads/21317/roogiA4xOQrWQgoXja4TWm27/tokyo_firebombing.jpg\">the charred corpse of a woman in Tokyo who was carrying a child on her back</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/21317/roogiA4xOQrWQgoXja4TWm27/tokyo_firebombing.jpg\" title=\"the charred corpse of a woman in Tokyo who was carrying a child on her back\"><img src=\"user_uploads/21317/roogiA4xOQrWQgoXja4TWm27/tokyo_firebombing.jpg\"></a></div><p>When the Germans admitted defeat, the Manhattan Project lost its original rationale, but the scientists continued work on building a bomb — and after they built on, the US dropped two on Japanese cities, over the protests of some (but certainly not all) the scientists.

At the risk of really kicking the heat in this discussion up a notch, I would compare this to the concept of defunding the police.

He was one of the leaders of the Manhattan project, he never regretted a thing about it, and he was actually also part of the team that evaluated which cities would make the best target for the bomb. He literally picked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's a slippery slope but it's difficult to make more mass murderer points than this if you are a scientist.</li>\n<li>The US global power should really be curtailed (if only T_T). No offense but since 2001 US foreign policy didn't bring anything but problems, at least here in the EU.  I have been provocative about this many times, but I'll say it again: From an EU perspective, Trump was a blessing. Having the US without any real foreign policy for 4 years has been simply awesome for us. And I'm pretty sure that now that you have someone with a brain in power again, our relationships with Russia (that is our neighbour, btw) will just get much worse.</li>\n<li>The US is still the global leader in the world. If you think nations like China are now in control you are being naive. There are many reasons for this, but the main ones are that the US have the biggest military in the world and much more importantly total control of the oceans, which are fundamental commercial routes.</li>\n<li>I don't like rationalistic arguments like the ones <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280784\">@Joshua Meyers</span> was doing. I can understand that rationalism is very appealing for mathematicians, but it leads very easily to discard moral arguments, which in some cases are fundamental. The  result of applying a rationalist way of thinking in fields that should benefit also from a moral judgement can be seen in projects like effective altruism, which seem rationally sound but end up being just a discriminatory bollocks shitshow. With this I'm not saying that one shouldn't better motivate things, I'm just saying that analyzing moral-related issues like they were theorems can be dangerous.</li>\n</ul>",

Steve said earlier that \"If you are foolish you are responsible for being foolish\", but that strikes me as too simplistic.<br>\nBehaviour judged to be foolish can be a result of a (perceived) failure of knowledge (ignorance) or a failure of reasoning. In either case, the accusation of foolishness contains the implication that the person <em>should</em> have known or reasoned better, and that obligation is the basis for assigning them responsibility for the consequences of their actions. But it's rarely possible to make such a judgement objectively, and it certainly isn't true that a person is always responsible for their own ignorance or inability to reason correctly. A bad teacher might hold their student responsible for failing to answer a question in class, but ultimately it is that teacher's responsibility to ensure that their student is equipped to answer those questions.</p>\n<p>I maintain that being \"foolish\" doesn't make you responsible for the actions of others; at worst, it makes you vulnerable to them.

I agree with the fact that it's bad that people are killed by organized group of people with weapon, like national armies or terrorist organizations. I want to minimize the number of people who are killed by these organized group of people with weapon. I'm not convinced of what is the most efficient strategy for this but I'm ready to hear rigorous explanations.</p>\n<p>2) It is much more scientifically established that the world will be less stable with a few more degrees in the average temperatures. By less stable, I mean in particular a world where there is more people who die by \"unnatural causes\" or suffer of various issues. It thus comes more easily to my mind to prioritize this point. I will not give you your best way of acting as it has been previously discussed in another thread.</p>\n<p>3) I think that Grothendieck explained rightly how the world of math scholars suffer of some issues like people being more concerned by social recognition than acting rightly, in Récoltes et Semailles. I think that here, people are happy to agree on the proposition (*) because it is more or less widely accepted by their friends and it is always nice to feel part of a community who agree on similar things. It is not about social recognition but also more a social behavior than really something about morality even if I'm sure that you all want to act morally at the end. Grothendieck didn't agree with this because he was strongly against funding by military but he got the point of (social aspects) &gt; (real morality) for mathematicians I think. </p>\n<p>In my opinion, these three propositions are more or less true. I admit that I have not carefully read every message and that I'm not extremely subtle, but I can't not saying what I think. I'm ready to hear every constructive criticism but I don't think that we are going to make more progress than in the thread about conferences.

Most of you seem to agree that :</p>\n<p>(*) being funded by the military is bad. Because military are mean and want to kill people and they can use your research to develop themselves and kill more people. </p>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n<p>1) We don't know if the world would be less or more stable without the military, especially the military from the US. I agree with the fact that it's bad that people are killed by organized group of people with weapon, like national armies or terrorist organizations. I want to minimize the number of people who are killed by these organized group of people with weapon. I'm not convinced of what is the most efficient strategy for this but I'm ready to hear rigorous explanations.</p>\n<p>2) It is much more scientifically established that the world will be less stable with a few more degrees in the average temperatures. By less stable, I mean in particular a world where there is more people who die by \"unnatural causes\" or suffer of various issues. It thus comes more easily to my mind to prioritize this point. I will not give you your best way of acting as it has been previously discussed in another thread.</p>\n<p>3) I think that Grothendieck explained rightly how the world of math scholars suffer of some issues like people being more concerned by social recognition than acting rightly, in Récoltes et Semailles. I think that here, people are happy to agree on the proposition (*) because it is more or less widely accepted by their friends and it is always nice to feel part of a community who agree on similar things. It is not about social recognition but also more a social behavior than really something about morality even if I'm sure that you all want to act morally at the end. Grothendieck didn't agree with this because he was strongly against funding by military but he got the point of (social aspects) &gt; (real morality) for mathematicians I think. </p>\n<p>In my opinion, these three propositions are more or less true. I admit that I have not carefully read every message and that I'm not extremely subtle, but I can't not saying what I think. I'm ready to hear every constructive criticism but I don't think that we are going to make more progress than in the thread about conferences. Thus, I'm not sure that I really want to discuss more this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I think to me, and to many other people, it doesn't matter if the military is good, actually. You still don't want to work with them. Let me try to explain with an analogy: a doctor might be able to save 10 people, by killing one and harvesting their organs. In a utlitarian sense this might be a good thing to do. But I think it is very reasonable if the doctor doesn't want to do this. Someone could ask, but why, don't you want to save all those other people? And I don't think the doctor has to give any other explanation than \"I don't want to, it feels icky\".<br>\nThat to me is how working for the military would feel.<br>\nNow, maybe it is good that there are other people that don't have this feeling of ickyness, and they can explain why it is perfectly fine. But to me that still probably wouldn't convince me.</p>",

Do y'all think they don't cross-pollinate with money and jobs? I personally was acquainted with a NSA mathematician who went on to NSF, and in government funding discussions where DoD vs NSF buckets of money were a prominent topic. From my experience drawing any line would be a pretty arbitrary exercise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This question turned out to be a lot more interesting than I expected. I'm quoting from <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter16&amp;edition=prelim\">here</a>. When the NSF was founded in 1950, its directives were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>§1862. Functions<br>\n(a) Initiation and support of studies and programs; scholarships; current register of scientific and engineering personnel<br>\nThe Foundation is authorized and directed—<br>\n(1) to initiate and support basic scientific research and programs to strengthen scientific research potential and science education programs at all levels in the mathematical, physical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences, and to initiate and support research fundamental to the engineering process and programs to strengthen engineering research potential and engineering education programs at all levels in the various fields of engineering, by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants, loans, and other forms of assistance) to support such scientific, engineering, and educational activities and to appraise the impact of research upon industrial development and upon the general welfare;<br>\n(2) to award, as provided in section 1869 of this title, scholarships and graduate fellowships for study and research in the sciences or in engineering;<br>\n(3) to foster the interchange of scientific and engineering information among scientists and engineers in the United States and foreign countries;<br>\n(4) to foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering;<br>\n(5) to evaluate the status and needs of the various sciences and fields of engineering as evidenced by programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, by individuals, and by public and private research groups, employing by grant or contract such consulting services as it may deem necessary for the purpose of such evaluations; and to take into consideration the results of such evaluations in correlating the research and educational programs undertaken or supported by the Foundation with programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, by individuals, and by public and private research groups;<br>\n(6) to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on scientific and engineering resources and to provide a source of information for policy formulation by other agencies of the Federal Government;<br>\n(7) to initiate and maintain a program for the determination of the total amount of money for scientific and engineering research, including money allocated for the construction of the facilities wherein such research is conducted, received by each educational institution and appropriate nonprofit organization in the United States, by grant, contract, or other arrangement from agencies of the Federal Government, and to report annually thereon to the President and the Congress; and<br>\n(8) to take a leading role in fostering and supporting research and education activities to improve the security of networked information systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, while interacting with other organisations, this was designed to be a foundation for direct support of science research, without particular prejudice regarding its applications.</p>\n<p>However, in the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2010, quoted on the NSF website, a \"broader impacts review criterion\" has been added to projects supported by the foundation which evaluates the following points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>§1862p–14. Broader Impacts Review Criterion<br>\n(a) Goals<br>\nThe Foundation shall apply a broader impacts review criterion to identify and demonstrate project support of the following goals:<br>\n(1) Increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States.<br>\n(2) Advancing of the health and welfare of the American public.<br>\n(3) Supporting the national defense of the United States.<br>\n(4) Enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States.<br>\n(5) Developing an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive through improved pre-kindergarten through grade 12 STEM education and teacher development, and improved undergraduate STEM education and instruction.<br>\n(6) Improving public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the United States.<br>\n(7) Expanding participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, point (3) makes it somewhat easier (hard for me to judge how much) for projects related to national defense to get funding.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, any national funding has a budget and some of its priorities determined by the government and lawmakers of that country. If I were in the US and faced with the choice between DoD funding and NSF funding, it's still pretty clear to me that the latter would be preferable, since I can aim to get my research funded in support of points (2), (6) and (7) of the criteria above (for example), while avoiding reliance on my work's value with respect to the other criteria.</p>\n<p>The fact that people pass between these sources of funding is irrelevant. The line exists to the extent that funding decisions are taken independently by the two organisations.</p>",

So DoD said \"let NSF start planting seeds from their bucket instead of us\" with the intent of seeing what worked and what didn't. That NSF money was still advancing DoD's goals in accordance with DoD's plans.</p>",

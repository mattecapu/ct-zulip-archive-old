So, I don't want applied category theory to merely help people do what they're already doing, faster and more efficiently than they already are.    That will just drive our civilization off the cliff faster than we're already going.   It's quite hard to figure out how to do applied math that creates positive change, but some of us are trying to figure it out.   I'm glad that two of my students - Brendan Fong and Nina Otter - have set up institutes that seek to do this (among other things).</p>",

For example, I view monetary/financial systems as the decategorification of bartering. Not that I'm suggesting we all get back to bartering, but I could imagine everyone having a bartering app that allows for complex multiway exchanges of goods directly, without having to go through any numerical (monetary) device. We already to this with Kidney donation chains. Although it doesn't sound very practical in general.</p>",

So we need to (A) bring more people into the field and (B) make knowledge of ACT circulate more efficiently and freely.</li>\n<li>Other bottlenecks include funding (hard to find people who want to fund the things that are most important for ACT) and connection with other domains (can't do <em>Applied</em> CT unless CT-ists are working with domain experts, but this is a hard communication problem)</li>\n<li>(Some of) the ACT community has a shared sense that ACT can be a force for positive change.  But this can only happen if we can organize as a group and not just be comprised of individual researchers going where the funding is.  So we must determine shared feasible goals for how ACT can be used for good, and then coordinate around them.</li>\n</ol>",

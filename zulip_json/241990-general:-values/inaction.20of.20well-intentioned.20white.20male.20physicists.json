If I saw this as a student, my immediate reaction would be to sit sort of near Zina.  Did they mention this option?</p>\n<p>I'm not suggesting this is a complete solution to the problem, just a thing I'd do.</p>",

Isn't the student in that scenario under pressure to decline your efforts for the exact reasons that you're pointing out? At least if you take the initiative the other students have less ammunition for \"blaming\" the victim. But with that said what consequences are you actually imagining here that will be worse than the student's existing isolation from having to sit on their own during class?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think whether you are putting the responsibility on the student depends very much on how you approach them and which language you use. I think you should make it clear that you are absolutely happy to take action and want to, but that you want her blessing first</p>",

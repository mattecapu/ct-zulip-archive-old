That writing is none of the business of this zulip, although people here may hold some strong opinions about what they are discussing. </p>\n<p>To get one thing out of the way: obviously we're <em>all</em> human beings. As a human being, as a <em>general rule</em> I don't want to be told how I should write. I for one wouldn't be an asshole and \"double down\" on calling person P \"him\" if P wants to be called \"they\". But if we're talking about a person in the abstract, then maybe it would go against my grain, as a human being, to feel compelled to use singular \"they\" at times when I'd rather not. (Leaving aside how I, Todd Trimble, actually feel about this -- this is only an example. In other words, I'm using \"I\" in a peculiar way.) How people write is a very personal thing and can be something deeply felt. </p>\n<p>Since actually \"in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which mostly means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour\" does carry more than a whiff of laying down the law -- especially since the notion of <em>power</em> was invoked, I for one would want to get clear on what, then, is considered acceptable to powers that be. The aforementioned episode of Monica Cellio shows what can happen: she was asking whether use of pronouns is <em>compulsory</em> in situations where such use could be avoided (as is virtually always the case, for competent writers). For example, she noted that there may be situations, involving human beings whose first language is not English and who are not immersed in debates involving political correctness, where use of an ostensibly plural form could be genuinely confusing or unclear. And for making inquiries into what the newly emerging Stack Exchange policy was, precisely, she wound up being stripped of her position, and with damage to her reputation. The episode was quite hideous. </p>\n<p>Casting the discussion in terms of \"grammatical correctness [being] more important than who somebody is as a human being\" is putting it pretty tendentiously and in black-and-white terms, in my opinion. There are some nuances here. </p>\n<p>By the way, as a moderator myself (over at MathOverflow), I know it's not always an easy job -- and I've had accusations of being \"PC police\" flung in my direction <em>plenty</em> over the years. It's super-hard threading the needle, sometimes. I hope you don't mind weathering the storm <em>too</em> much.</p>",

I find it cleaner and more accurate to conceptualize gender as a one-dimensional interval than a collection of two points labelled \"he\" and \"she\" (although this interval model is far from perfect, and one could also argue that \"he\" and \"she\" could also be conceptualized differently). However, in this interval model for gender, it is then tricky to concisely refer to a point (or subinterval) on this interval in a concise and convenient way. The potentially lower degree of gender-specificity in \"they\" strikes me as a reasonable way to indicate the usage of this 1D model for gender. I'd prefer using \"their\" to \"he or she\" for a similar reason - in my mental model for gender \"he or she\" refers to a collection of two points, while \"their\" refers again to the use of a 1D object for modelling gender.<br>\nHopefully these thoughts are roughly on topic!</p>",

We&#39;re trying to work out something sensitive in a public discussion, and that involves some back and forth, misunderstandings, flaring tempers, accusations (and worse).  But please don&#39;t unfairly, and blanketly, accuse the people having the discussion in good faith of something unjustified that could stick to them.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276770\">@Steve Awodey</span> I think what Jules is referring to as 'gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour' is for example when Mike Shulman explicitly says that people describing themselves as 'transgender, non-binary, etc' sometimes behave in ways that make him 'uncomfortable'. In this case, I think the 'accusation' of being exclusionary is a fairly accurate representation of the situation and Mike Shulman's actions.</p>\n<p>I think you make a great point about the necessity to avoid unfair blanket accusations. For example, I would argue that it was an unfair blanket accusation when Mike Shulman claimed that  \"there is a movement to replace the fact of biological sex with a socially constructed non-binary notion of gender\", a claim that had nothing to do with the PR in question, but served to blanket-paint people Mike disagrees with as ideologically driven. </p>\n<p>Since you are actively involved in the discussions both here and on github, is it fair that you're chastising Jules for stating a concrete, verifiable claim, while mentioning nothing to Mike for whom your comment is far more appropriate?</p>",

        "content": "<p>To be frank, as a person belonging to the conservative side of the political spectrum regarding many issues, much of the public discourse around inclusivity policy makes me feel very much excluded almost all the time. I have multiple times being afraid to speak my mind openly especially on public channels like Twitter. Basically, as someone having opinions sometimes orthogonal to what is the more common posture in academia, the risk of people misreading, misunderstanding and deciding to tag me as a bigot or as a fascist make it just not worth it. Obviously I do not consider myself either of the two, and especially I consider fascism utterly repulsive, but experience has taught me that it is easier for people to simplify and distort your opinion when they do not agree with you. Some people actually may even find doing so enjoyable. And yes, this has often very tangible consequences.</p>\n<p>...The way I personally cope with this is by saying absolutely nothing, avoiding mentioning politics/value/morals as much as I can especially on the internet, and basically keeping my opinions to myself. But if I have to be frank no, I do not think that many of the inclusive policies I've seen around are as inclusive as people promoting them think they are. And no, I will refrain from being more specific than this, especially in public, exactly due to what I've said above.</p>",

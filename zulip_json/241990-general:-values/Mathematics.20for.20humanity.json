Again, the above discussion proves people are low-key thinking about this but nobody had 'the' idea yet, though many hints are around. We need to be together for long enough to recognize the pattern.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattecapu/status/1521754567280578560?s=20&amp;t=AQ2W88Nacn28y90pmOdWtQ\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/6aa2f4e0661ba68daabb4fcbf5b432996abf0eb7/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f313530363539393233313731323338323937372f2d777954346b46715f6e6f726d616c2e6a7067\"></a><p>This theorem by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myers_jaz\">@myers_jaz</a> is likely one of the most important results in applied category theory so far.

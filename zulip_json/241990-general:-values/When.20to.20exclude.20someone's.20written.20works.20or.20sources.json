I have also personally recommended Peter Smith's guide \"Teach Yourself Logic\" to people on occasion. There are lots of good resources on his blog.</p>\n<p>However, Peter Smith is a bad person and should be persona non grata in the community of logicians and category theorists. He has committed some horrifying crimes, the specifics of which are perhaps better left unsaid. Certainly I would strongly encourage any convention or conference not to invite him. I would like to pose it as an open question for discussion: if the person themselves is absolutely unwelcome in the community because of their behavior, should that extend to their published work, blogs and so on?</p>\n<p>Would it be better to compose alternative resources? I don't know, honestly. Is there any real harm in linking somebody to his blog or website? Is it worth warning people \"Oh, yes, this is also a really bad guy who should not be welcome here\"</p>",

If the person wrote a good book on logic or category theory, I don't think that his book should be forgotten forever in addition to the proportionate punishment that would have been  decided by relevant authorities, in accordance to the laws, if the crime has been recognized. Justice is something complex and I think judges are better than me to judge people. We no longer condemn people to death, in the same way I don't think that mob justice is something good in the panel of primitive ways to do justice. No need to \"kill socially\" someone because I think he is a bad person. Was someone be considered as a monster, I will not forbid myself to read his book on something completely unrelated to these crimes. I can accept that someone has dark and bright sides. Let's say people are \"compositional systems\". The mathematical intelligence of a person is something different than the rest of this person. It can be found in different persons, bad or not bad in terms of other components.</p>",

I have also personally recommended Peter Smith's guide \"Teach Yourself Logic\" to people on occasion. There are lots of good resources on his blog.</p>\n<p>However, Peter Smith is a bad person and should be persona non grata in the community of logicians and category theorists. He has committed some horrifying crimes, the specifics of which are perhaps better left unsaid. Certainly I would strongly encourage any convention or conference not to invite him. I would like to pose it as an open question for discussion: if the person themselves is absolutely unwelcome in the community because of their behavior, should that extend to their published work, blogs and so on?</p>\n<p>Would it be better to compose alternative resources? I don't know, honestly. Is there any real harm in linking somebody to his blog or website? Is it worth warning people \"Oh, yes, this is also a really bad guy who should not be welcome here\"</p>",

One perspective is that lenses are \"things that compose by a chain rule\" - structurally the same as the usual chain rule, although not necessarily involving actual differentiation. This is the foundation of the \"categorical cybernetics\" project, which aims to attack problems in optimisation using tools from category theory. I will introduce lenses assuming no background knowledge of category theory, and sketch some of their applications.</p>\n<p>Bio: Jules is a lecturer in the Computer &amp; Information Sciences department at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. He was previously at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig, and the Computer Science department at Oxford. His background is mixed between mathematics and theoretical computer science, and he is mostly interested in applications of category theory in microeconomics.</p>",

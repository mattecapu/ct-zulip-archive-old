These two fundamental aspects of logic are studied using almost disjoint technical languages and methods, by almost disjoint research communities. We believe that bridging this divide is a major issue in Computer Science, and may hold the key to fundamental advances in the field.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the this community, category theory is a fundamental component of the \"Structure\" component of the workshop. Typically the \"Power\" component might be represented by (finite) model theory, combinatorics, complexity theory and the study of algorithms.</p>\n<p>The deadline for submissions is 20th May 2022. Details can be found in the call for papers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/cfp/smp-2022\">https://easychair.org/cfp/smp-2022</a></p>\n<p>The workshop will be run as a hybrid event, although on site participation is highly recommended.</p>",

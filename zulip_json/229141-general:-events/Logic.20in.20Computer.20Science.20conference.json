This said, I do not quite see what the connection to computer science is or could possibly be, and I wish the authors had made some attempt in the introduction to connect this work to some part of CS; there is a short paragraph in which the authors speculate about a possible connection to relational databases, but the link appears tenuous at best; the conclusion does not help much either as it states various possible future avenues of research in category theory. I find it difficult to recommend acceptance under the circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think I'll be submitting any more theoretical work to LICS.

That's the stuff of STOC, FOCS, SODA...

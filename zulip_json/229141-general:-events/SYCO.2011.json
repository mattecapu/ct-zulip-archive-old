Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,<br>\nOxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,<br>\nphysics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion,<br>\ndisseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is<br>\nencouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both<br>\nestablished academics and junior researchers, including students. Submissions is<br>\neasy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have<br>\nproceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published<br>\nelsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or<br>\neven a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>\n<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions with a<br>\ncompositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from<br>\nthe perspective of category theory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and quantum<br>\n   programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine<br>\n   learning;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction<br>\n   networks;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory<br>\n   and game semantics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal category theory,<br>\n   higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy<br>\n   theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants,<br>\n   and game theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world problem<br>\n   descriptions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>\n===============</p>\n<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: Monday 6 March, 2023<br>\nAuthor notification: Sunday 20 March, 2023<br>\nSymposium dates: Thursday 20 and Friday 21 April 2023</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br>\n=======================</p>\n<p>Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 11 submission page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2023/Symposium\">https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2023/Symposium</a></p>\n<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The<br>\nmeeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been<br>\nsubmitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively: you could submit a recent<br>\npaper, or notes on work in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>\n<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be<br>\naccommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to <em>defer</em><br>\nsome submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. Deferred<br>\nsubmissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO meeting, where they will not<br>\nneed peer review, and where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the<br>\nprogramme. Meetings will be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of<br>\ndeferred papers.</p>\n<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO meeting, it<br>\nwill not automatically be considered for SYCO 11; you still need to submit it<br>\nagain through OpenReview. When submitting, append the words \"DEFERRED FROM SYCO<br>\nX\" to the title of your paper, replacing \"X\" with the appropriate meeting<br>\nnumber. There is no need to attach any documents.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE<br>\n===================</p>\n<p>The PC chair is Bryce Clarke, Inria Saclay. The Programme Committee will<br>\nbe announced soon.</p>\n<p>STEERING COMMITTEE<br>\n==================</p>\n<p>Ross Duncan, University of Strathclyde<br>\nChris Heunen, University of Edinburgh<br>\nDominic Horsman, University of Oxford<br>\nAleks Kissinger, University of Oxford<br>\nSamuel Mimram, Ã‰cole Polytechnique<br>\nSimona Paoli, University of Aberdeen<br>\nMehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, University College London<br>\nPawel Sobocinski, Tallinn University of Technology<br>\nJamie Vicary, University of Cambridge</p>",

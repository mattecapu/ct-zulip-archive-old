        "content": "<p>INTERCATS: SEMINAR ON CATEGORICAL INTERACTION<br>\n=============================================</p>\n<p>ANNOUNCEMENT</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Intercats is a new seminar series on the mathematics of interacting systems, their composition, and their behaviour. Split in equal parts theory and applications, we are particularly interested in category-theoretic tools to make sense of information-processing or adaptive systems, or those that stand in a 'bidirectional' relationship to some environment. We aim to bring together researchers from different communities, who may already be using similar-but-different tools, in order to improve our own interaction.</p>\n<p>Seminars will be held every other Tuesday at 17:00 UTC, beginning on the 25th of January.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://topos.site/intercats\">https://topos.site/intercats</a></p>\n<p>FIRST MEETING</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Speaker:  David Spivak</p>\n<p>Date: 2022 / 01 / 25</p>\n<p>Time: 17:00 UTC</p>\n<p>INTERCATS SCOPE</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Although by no means an exhaustive or prescriptive list, Intercats seminar topics are likely to be related to the following mathematical topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalized lenses, optics, and related structures, such as Chu spaces or Dialectica categories;</li>\n<li>polynomial functors, and their associated ecosystem;</li>\n<li>applications of the foregoing to:<ul>\n<li>bidirectional processes,</li>\n<li>dynamical systems,</li>\n<li>wiring diagrams,</li>\n<li>open games,</li>\n<li>database theory,</li>\n<li>automatic differentiation,</li>\n<li>computational statistics,</li>\n<li>machine learning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ORGANIZERS</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Jules Hedges, University of Strathclyde<br>\nDavid Spivak, Topos Institute<br>\nToby St Clere Smithe, Topos Institute</p>",

I'll then discuss polynomial functors and the associated framed bicategory Cat# of comonoids. I'll say a bit about how Cat# fits into the above stories and spend the remainder of the time trying to give a hint as to the astounding amount of structure this category has.</p>\n<p>One might think of Cat# like the complex numbers: simultaneously extremely useful in applications and extremely mathematically well-behaved, the combination of which gives a sense of its being more \"part of nature\" than \"human-made\".</p>",

        "content": "<p>Abstract: The number of variants of lens-like structures, plus some questionable terminology, can seem overwhelming. I will tour some of the main variants, with emphasis on exactly what conditions on the base category are necessary for the construction, and how they relate to each other. We will visit: (1) lenses over a cartesian category, (2) linear lenses over a monoidal closed category, (3) optics over a monoidal category, or more generally a pair of actegories, (4) dependent lenses over a category with pullbacks, or more generally an indexed category, and (5) polynomial natural transformations over a locally cartesian closed category. Unifying these motivates the problem of “dependent optics”, which will be the topic of several future seminars.</p>\n<p>I am on strike action during this talk and I represent myself as an independent researcher, not my employer. I will use some of my time to discuss this.

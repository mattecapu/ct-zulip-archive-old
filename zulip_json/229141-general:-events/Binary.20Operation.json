We now have a <a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@binary_operation\">Mastodon account</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/binary2operation/\">Instagram account</a>, although we're still deciding how to use both of these; please follow if you're on these platforms!</p>\n<p>The next stream will be tomorrow (Sunday) from 9:30am Paris time. We'll be diving deeper into finding out what <strong>asymptotic invariance of the distribution of stuff in the universe</strong> would look like. If that's a strange enough sentence to make you curious, please do drop by... It will be a physics-inspired examination of how symmetry interacts with complexity classes/asymptotic behaviour of functions.</p>\n<p>If you don't have a Twitch account (you don't need one to watch, but you would need one to leave a comment during the stream), feel free to send questions either here or through the platforms mentioned above.</p>",

I wonder if anyone here has thought about asymptotic analysis and could lend us some insight?</p>",

Last time we figured out what it means to solve an asymptotic equation in one dimension; this time we'll be jumping up to three! I expect this will be the last session on asymptotic analysis (unless we make an exciting breakthrough that we can't help following up on), so do send us some suggestions for what you'd like to see us think about next.</p>\n<p>Also, I'd like to give a shout out to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"284005\">@Ralph Sarkis</span>, who has managed to attend every stream up to now and is our all-round biggest supporter. Thanks Ralph!</p>",

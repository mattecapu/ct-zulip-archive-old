Admittedly, this may be a problem with the structure of our group, but I think it would be good if this sort of thing could be mediated by the senior members of the comittee.</p>\n<p>This seems kind of exclusionary.  Given that the conference is supposed to broadly represent applied category theory as a discipline, I think it would be better if the criteria were made clear.  And moreover, I think it is important that people from all groups who are working on applied category theory are equally represented in deciding which papers are accepted, and thus, to shape the future of the community.</p>\n<p>Of course, these things are usually decided by professors behind closed doors, which I am not privy to as a PhD student, but the fact that there are PhD students on the program comittee is very unusual.</p>\n<p>This is just my opinion as a PhD student, and I have no right to have any influence over the direction of the conference, of course.

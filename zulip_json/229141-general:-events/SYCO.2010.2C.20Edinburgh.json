Previous SYCO events have been held in<br>\nBirmingham, Strathclyde, Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,<br>\nmathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of<br>\nfostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading<br>\nknowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature<br>\nresearch and work in progress, and by both established academics and<br>\njunior researchers, including students. Submissions is easy, with no<br>\nformatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so<br>\nwork can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere.<br>\nYou could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a<br>\nPhD or Masters thesis.</p>\n<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions<br>\nwith a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in<br>\nparticular from the perspective of category theory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and<br>\nquantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language<br>\nprocessing and machine learning;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and<br>\nreaction networks;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,<br>\ntype theory and game semantics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal<br>\ncategory theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and<br>\nrelationships to homotopy theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation<br>\ntheory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof<br>\nassistants, and game theory;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world<br>\nproblem descriptions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES </strong></p>\n<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: Monday 7 November, 2022<br>\nAuthor notification: Sunday 20 November, 2022<br>\nSymposium dates: Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 December 2022</p>\n<p><strong> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS </strong></p>\n<p>Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 10 submission page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium\">https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium</a></p>\n<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.<br>\nThe meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even<br>\nif it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively:<br>\nyou could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even<br>\na recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>\n<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can<br>\nbe accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose<br>\nto <em>defer</em> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject<br>\nthem. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO<br>\nmeeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be<br>\nprioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held<br>\nsufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>\n<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO<br>\nmeeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 10; you still<br>\nneed to submit it again through OpenReview. When submitting, append the<br>\nwords \"DEFERRED FROM SYCO X\" to the title of your paper, replacing \"X\"<br>\nwith the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any<br>\ndocuments.</p>\n<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>\n<p>The PC chair is Robin Kaarsgaard, University of Edinburgh. The Programme<br>\nCommittee will be announced soon.</p>\n<p><strong> STEERING COMMITTEE </strong></p>\n<p>Ross Duncan, University of Strathclyde<br>\nChris Heunen, University of Edinburgh<br>\nDominic Horsman, University of Oxford<br>\nAleks Kissinger, University of Oxford<br>\nSamuel Mimram, Ã‰cole Polytechnique<br>\nSimona Paoli, University of Aberdeen<br>\nMehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, University College London<br>\nPawel Sobocinski, Tallinn University of Technology<br>\nJamie Vicary, University of Cambridge</p>",

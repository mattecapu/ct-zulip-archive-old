The aim is to create an arena for the dissemination and the discussion of cutting-edge research in category theory, bringing together a community of mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists using category theory in their research. There will be three day-long meetings a year.   The first meeting will be held in Edinburgh Wednesday 14th June.</p>\n<p>(This is all I know: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301248\">@Chris Heunen</span> will eventually tell us more.)</p>",

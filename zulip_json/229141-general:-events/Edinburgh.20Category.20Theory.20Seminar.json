On the one hand, the Banach fixed point theorem is a staple of undergraduate courses on metric spaces. On the other, metric spaces can usefully be seen as enriched categories. This raises the question of whether the Banach fixed point theorem can be understood categorically. I will talk about the search for an answer, opening up avenues of investigation without, yet, being able to say what lies at the end of them.</p>\n</blockquote>",

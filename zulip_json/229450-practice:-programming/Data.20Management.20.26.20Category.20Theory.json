I'm working in bioinformatics, but with a background in maths/stats and some experience with group theory (but only a rough understanding of the basics of category theory).</p>\n<p>I'm fed up with compromises with data management, so I want to create a well-designed, robust framework for the language I use for data analysis (Julia). So far, I've written a bit of a manifesto with my thoughts on data management (<a href=\"https://tecosaur.com/public/DataManagement.html\">https://tecosaur.com/public/DataManagement.html</a>). At the end of this, I have a suspicion that my approach might be able to be reformulated as a category theory problem, and in doing so provide a clean abstraction/model for what I'm doing.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don't know enough about category theory to take my suspicion any further, which is where I'm hoping you fine folks might be able to help me out <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.</p>",

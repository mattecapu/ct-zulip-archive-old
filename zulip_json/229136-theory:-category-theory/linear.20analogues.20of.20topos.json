Has anyone seen any work on enriched versions of topos? I'm interested in the geometric point of view (so topos as classifying spaces of theories and geometric morphisms) and not in the elementary topos (or even logos) point of view. </p>\n<p>In non-commutative geometry, one often sees Grothendieck abelian categories and locally presentable stable categories (probably with an additional monoidal structure) as avatars for spaces up to Morita equivalence. Still, I have never seen a translation of the usual topological concepts in topos theory to that setting. For instance, in that linear setting, what's the analogous of a localic morphism? Or, say, an open morphism? I'm aware about r√©collement, torsion theories and some of the several spectrum constructions, though. But that's pretty much as far as I know the analogy goes.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't be surprised, however, if maybe someone working with cosmos and linear logic has already done implicitly something like that in a very general setting.  </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

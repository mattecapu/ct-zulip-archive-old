And you can show that the monad is necessarily symmetric monoidal as well. So that paper is wrong in saying their monad is not symmetric monoidal. I guess this shows that their models cannot be <em>monadic</em> adjunctions (none of their examples were anyway).</p>\n<p>I guess this is a generalization of Eckmann-Hilton?</p>",

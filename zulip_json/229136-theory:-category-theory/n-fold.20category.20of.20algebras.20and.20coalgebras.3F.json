Then also we could have a morphism between different types of 0-cells - which would be the coalgebra-to-algebra morphisms.  (There's also the algebra-to-coalgebra morphism) which follows in a similar way.</p>\n<p>Question: what kind of structure is this? It's not a double category, as I initially suspected.

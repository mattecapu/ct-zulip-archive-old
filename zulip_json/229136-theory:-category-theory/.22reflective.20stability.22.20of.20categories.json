(Its composite.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To clarify, here's how to recover that a category C is...<br>\n  ...associative: Let's define precategories C_left and C_right: Let p be a path in C. If it hasn't length 3, it composes as in C. If it does have the form (f,g,h), it composes to C(C(f,g),h) in C_left and to C(f,C(g,h)) in C_right. Since we've now built C_left and C_right from C, they are C.<br>\n  ...unital: You could use C to conjure arrows from empty paths, then sprinkle them into other paths before you compose. By the property of C, those arrows do nothing.</p>\n<p>A functor from C to D is then an object map f plus an f-on-objects map from paths in C to arrows in D given which you can only build that one.</p>\n<p>In Haskell terms:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>data Path q where Nil :: Path q s s; Snoc :: Path q s t -&gt; q t u -&gt; Path q s u\ntype Precategory q = forall s t. Path q s t -&gt; q s t\ntype Redefinition = forall q. Precategory q -&gt; Precategory q\n-- A category is a precategory on which all redefinitions agree.

(Precategory q, Precategory r, Prefunctor f q r) -&gt; Prefunctor f q r\n-- A functor is a prefunctor between categories on which all redefinition2s agree.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Remark: There is exactly one \"forall q. Precategory (Path q)\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/05/postulated_colimits_and_absolu.html#c041397\">Tom Leinster's \"possible to even mention\" concept</a> is possible to mention here.</p>\n<p>Might one characterize the structure of <strong>Quiv</strong> by this property corresponding to unitality and associativity?<br>\nThe jackpot case would be that this is a compact enough seed for category theory that one can calculate out a grid of all sensible math concepts, making clever definitions obsolete and math tractable.</p>\n<p>Anyway. Ideas? Prior work?</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Kleisli category is a full subcategory of the Eilenberg-Moore category.  The subcategory inclusion therefore reflects limits.  The forgetful functor from the Eilenberg-Moore category creates all limits that exist in the underlying category, including pullbacks in the case of a Cartesian monad.  Therefore pullbacks in the Kleisli category are reflected from pullbacks in the underlying category, via the inclusion in the EM category.  This doesn't mean they necessarily exist because the pullback of two free algebras may not be free.  Even with a Cartesian monad pullbacks seem to only be guaranteed to stay free when both of the morphisms being pulled back are \"free morphisms\", which is usually not the case.  <em>However</em>, in general the pullback can still exist in the Kleisli category even when there isn't a reflected pullback, because the pullback might not be preserved by the inclusion!  So I really seem to be back where I started, and messing around with diagram chases hasn't seemed more helpful.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Ross Street has commented that his work on \"cosmoi\" has a logical aspect to it. The notation is meant to evoke set theory; he writes PA for the category of presheaves on A (P also stands for powerset) and suggests that the Yoneda embedding is like the singleton embedding A -&gt; PA. The axioms he takes, he says, are inspired by categorifying the substitution properties of equality. However, this is all he says about logic. The rest of his papers on this appear to be pure category theory. </p>\n<p>I think this idea is very interesting. In particular Kan extensions of V-valued functors would play the role of quantification. Thus a left Kan extension of a presheaf P along a functor F is an \"image\" of P along F. An element of lim P is a proof that \"for all c, P(c)\". </p>\n<p>What has been made of this from a logical point of view? Have any type theorists written down a formal theory which can be interpreted in cosmoi? I tried to work it out but it seems subtle. The pun with equality is difficult to formalize because this \"equality\" is not symmetric in general unless the category is a groupoid. It is maybe more like a reducibility relation than an equivalence relation.</p>",

That is, have people verified any of the various semistrictification conjectures for n=4? I'm thinking strict everything except interchange, or <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Simpson%27s+conjecture\">strict everything except units</a>. Degenerate versions of this may have been checked, for instance braided monoidal bicategories, but I'm feeling a bit lazy to track something down. This is pretty much at the limit of what is feasible, perhaps, clearly higher versions need different definitions of n-categories. But just as Gordon, Power and Street's work was a catalyst for finding out subtleties of (3,3)-categories (i.e. not (3,1)-categories!), might there be fun things hiding in the tetracategorical case?</p>",

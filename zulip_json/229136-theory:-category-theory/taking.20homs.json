The idea is that Hom objects inherit all kinds of information from the parent category, but at a lower level in the categorical sense. The basic examples are: Hom objects are sets, and endo-hom objects are monoids. If the category is enriched, or monoidal, or a higher category, etc., all kinds of interesting things happen with these hom objects. It's often the punchline to a categorical story.<br>\nCalling this \"taking homs\" is not quite distinct enough terminology. It's a kind of decategorification, but really that's something else, like truncating or taking Pi-zero. There's the analogy of homs as categorified inner products, which is closer to what I'm talking about, but I don't know if any linear algebra terminology is satisfactory for this. <br>\nThe story might go like this: you are studying a commutative ring, and end up constructing the symmetric monoidal category of modules over this ring and proving something there. But you really are interested in the original commutative ring, so you take the endo-homs on the monoidal unit, and see what the result implies about this hom, because it is the ring you started with. I think Tannakian reconstruction is another example like this... Maybe \"reconstruction\" is the word i'm looking for? It's a bit strange to call it that, because it's more like a deconstruction, or looking down a microscope..</p>",

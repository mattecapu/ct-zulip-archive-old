This book did a great job at making category theory interesting to me, although the emphasis on \"ologs\" isn't to my preference.</p>\n<p>I haven't looked carefully at this book, but \"The Joy of Abstraction\" by Cheng I think has a few sections focused on examples along the lines you describe above.</p>\n<p>I should also mention \"Algebra: Chapter Zero\" by Aluffi. I find it hard reading, but very rewarding. I'm not sure I would call it \"maximally accessible\", but it does talk a bit about categories in the context of algebra.</p>",

This in turn was used in the proof of the Weil conjectures. I don't know much about it, but it feels like this is the perfect example of category theory being used in mathematics to prove concrete statements about the number of solutions of polynomial equations (over finite fields).</p>",

But I don't think he mentions the kind you're talking about.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This seems quite an unusual property to impose on an equipment: asking for every induced adjunction to be a coreflection is asking for every morphism in the underlying 2-category to be fully faithful. Accordingly, the condition is in a sense an equipment-theoretic version of <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cancellative+category\">left cancellative (2-)category</a>. I would suspect that such structures are not particularly widespread.</p>",

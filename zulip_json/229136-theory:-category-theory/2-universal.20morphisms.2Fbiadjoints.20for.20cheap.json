I.e., if I have G : D -&gt; C then a left bi-adjoint should be a functor F : C -&gt; D with a natural equivalence D(F A, B) =~ C(A, G B) but this is even more data than a 1-adjunction, so what is the minimalistic universal morphism version of a bi-adjoint? You have an action on objects and a unit C(A, G F A) such that composition with the unit (G - o \\eta) :   D(F A, B) -&gt; C(A, G B) is an equivalence of categories. Can it be simplified any further?</p>",

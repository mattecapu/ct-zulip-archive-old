For example in chemistry the behavior of atoms is random and we model it using the \"master equation\", but when there are lots of atoms this randomness may become insignificant and then we use the \"rate equation\", which is deterministic and much simpler.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf\">a free book</a> about Petri nets, the master equation and the rate equation.</p>",

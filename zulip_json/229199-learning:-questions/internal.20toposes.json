In practice, algebraic geometers who want to understand things like etale cohomology only need a small fraction of the theory that was developed by Grothendieck, such as the notion of a Grothendieck topology and the associated notion of sheaf. Many do not see the need to learn the version topos theory presented in SGA, and I suspect that the number who are interested in the subsequently developed theory of elementary topoi is vanishingly small. I do not see this as a failing of the algebraic geometry community: the notion of Grothendieck topology was quite useful to them, so they internalized it. Related ideas may be interesting for other reasons, but have had limited relevance to algebraic geometry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I don't think topos theory has any real applications in algebraic geometry, at least until somebody gives me one.</p>",

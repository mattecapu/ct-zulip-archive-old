I wonder what this corresponds to categorically... it gives me echoes of categorical systems theory. system dynamics staying constant and parameters being inputs, and for certain input values some kind of \"global\" change happens. i know ACT folks do a lot of dynamical systems work but even the CSS book doesn't mention bifurcations at all. is there any work on modeling them with CT?</p>",

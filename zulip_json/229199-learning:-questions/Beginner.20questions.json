You will probably get better participation and engagement if your questions are self-contained.  Links and excerpts are good for pointing to supplementary things, but if someone has to click on a link or picture to even know what you're talking about, most of the time most people won't bother, even when they could have helped.</p>\n<p>To use your previous question as an example, compare:<br>\n\"Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"<br>\nwith:<br>\n\"In [paper], [author] develops the idea of [idea].  Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"</p>\n<p>In the first case there's nothing to indicate whether I might have anything constructive to add until I click the image.  The second case gives context.  Now the image is a convenient reference.  If I know something about the topic, I'm more likely to click on the image in the second case.</p>",

To me, the word \"duality\" in 'Tannaka duality' is somewhat misleading, since the original theorem of Tannaka is just a correspondence of objects (there's no adjunction involved <em>a priori</em>), and although the construction of the category of representations can be made functorial, there is no natural functor in the opposite direction until one has restricted the class of categories (and suitable functors). Based on the Wikipedia page, I think this naming convention comes from thinking about this is an extension of Pontryagin duality (where a compact abelian group is assigned the dual group of its characters).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one can relate the <em>subjects</em> of Tannaka duality to Isbell duality! We can construct an adjunction between the left representations of groups and right representations of groups (left and right modules for the group ring) by the usual dualization procedure sending a vector space <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.22222em;\">V</span></span></span></span> to its dual <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>V</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">⊥</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">V^{\\bot}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8491em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.22222em;\">V</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8491em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">⊥</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, which inherits an action on the opposite side.

You will probably get better participation and engagement if your questions are self-contained.  Links and excerpts are good for pointing to supplementary things, but if someone has to click on a link or picture to even know what you're talking about, most of the time most people won't bother, even when they could have helped.</p>\n<p>To use your previous question as an example, compare:<br>\n\"Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"<br>\nwith:<br>\n\"In [paper], [author] develops the idea of [idea].  Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"</p>\n<p>In the first case there's nothing to indicate whether I might have anything constructive to add until I click the image.  The second case gives context.  Now the image is a convenient reference.  If I know something about the topic, I'm more likely to click on the image in the second case.</p>",

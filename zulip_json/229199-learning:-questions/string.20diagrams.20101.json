I'll use monoidal categories as an example. A monoidal category is either [almost a page long definition] or it's equivalently \"a place where string diagrams modulo planar isotopy are well-defined\" - that's in scare quotes but it can be made into a precise definition that's equivalent to the traditional one. I'd argue that the second thing is more intuitive to both understand and in <em>most</em> cases also to use, but the first thing can be seen as a finite axiomatisation of what the second thing is saying. That's a reversal of the usual perspective, like running the coherence theorem backwards: I'm saying that the (usual) definition of monoidal categories is a finite axiomatisation of planar isotopy of string diagrams, and it's <em>not obvious</em> that this should even be possible. The conclusion of that kind of line of thinking is basically that both perspectives are useful for different things, and it's useful to be able to shift back and forth between them. In particular, if you want to verify that a new category is monoidal, you definitely want to use the finite axiomatisation because then you just have a list of diagrams you need to check commute and then you're done</p>",

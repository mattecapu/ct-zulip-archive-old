There are lots of ways to do that.   With category theory I often explore topics by thinking about them in words using general principles.

The point is to take the category you're interested in and embed it by Yoneda in a category that models all the type theory of your proof assistant, including exponentials, distributivity, universes, etc.  Then whichever of those structures are preserved by the Yoneda embedding, like exponentials and products, can be used directly as operations on the \"representables\" inside your type theory, whereas the structures that are present in your category but aren't preserved by Yoneda, like sums, are asserted as separate structure on the representables that doesn't coincide with the structure of the ambient proof assistant type theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed! And for others in the room, this is in essence also the method that we used to prove metatheoretic results such as normalization for cubical type theory, except that we pass through not only the Yoneda embedding but a further open embedding until we reach a topos whose 'internal type theory' can state the properties we want to prove.</p>",

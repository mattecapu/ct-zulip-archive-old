This paper is the only reference I know for this fantastic result or any result like it. Does anyone know the history of analogous theorems about the equivalence between representable prop-like structures and weak 2-categorical structures?</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, it seems monoidal categories are equivalent to representable pros.<br>\nLikewise, it seems bicategories are equivalent to representable \"pros with colored regions\".</p>\n<p>What about double categories?<br>\nConsider a structure X defined by the analogy <em>monoidal category : pro :: double category : X</em>. This structure X is like a double category, except its 1-cells cannot compose (neither vertically nor horizontally), and its 2-cells are bordered by pasting diagrams of 1-cells rather than single 1-cells.</p>\n<p>Are doubly weak double categories equivalent to Xs that are both vertically and horizontally representable? Is this a good way to first wrap my head around doubly weak double categories?</p>",

But the idea is already present in Cockett and Seely's papers on linearly distributive categories (equivalent to polycategories “representable on both sides”). There is also a version “with coloured regions”: <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/linear+bicategory\">linear bicategories</a> are equivalent to representable <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/2/11-02abs.html\">poly-bicategories</a></p>\n<p>For people who are acquainted with this branch of “Canadian” category theory, I think the result about pros and props are mostly understood as degenerate versions of the result for polycategories: if a representable polycategory extends to a prop, then the “tensor” and “par” of the corresponding linearly distributive category collapse to a single operation, so the linearly distributive category is “actually” a monoidal category. </p>\n<p>I think this fact -- that the “representable prop” result is a “degenerate case” of a more refined result about polycategories -- may be why the prop result is hard to find in publications (I have also only seen it spelled out in Shulman's paper that you cite).</p>",

In truth, leader proposes: You make a move and there is an entire spectrum of things that are 'good reactions' for the follower to make. Usually there is one very obvious way to react to some proposition but a skilled follower can surprise you almost at every step. This is really funny because you can witness 'nonverbal arguments'  between leader and follower, where leader wants to do something and follower basically says 'no way I am going to do that!\", but from the point of view of an untrained person everything looks pretty  normal <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>",

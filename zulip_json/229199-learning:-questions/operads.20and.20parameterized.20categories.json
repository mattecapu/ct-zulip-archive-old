Also, as I understand it, one can construct an underlying operad from a monoidal category in general, so then it should be possible to construct an operad around a parameterized monoidal category? If so, has there been work in this direction? Since I think it should be possible, I have been looking for it, but haven't found anything yet.</p>",

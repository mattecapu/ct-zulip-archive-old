In that context, many usually employ the \"classic\" definition of graph transformation and try to generalize it in a way that plays well with the enrichment. I must stress that the focus is very different tho: most often one cares about graph rewriting that is done via single, double, sesqui-pushout and similar techniques. So in the end your definition of morphism is good as long as you have an adhesive category.</p>",

You might have a rule for example that whenever you \"find\" a graph G inside a graph H you \"replace\" G with H. Then you may chain these replacements together in increasingly complicated ways.  Deciding what exactly you mean by \"find\" and \"replace\" requires a certain amount of care, and I think the most common approach is to use double pushout rewriting.

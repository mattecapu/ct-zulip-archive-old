In that context, many usually employ the \"classic\" definition of graph transformation and try to generalize it in a way that plays well with the enrichment. I must stress that the focus is very different tho: most often one cares about graph rewriting that is done via single, double, sesqui-pushout and similar techniques. So in the end your definition of morphism is good as long as you have an adhesive category.</p>",

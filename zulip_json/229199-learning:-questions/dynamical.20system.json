Computer algebra systems can model the dynamics there with many fewer symbolic terms. More importantly, is the Lyapunov multiplier,  the value of a function's first derivative  at a fixed point. The multiplier is the dominant driver in the dynamics of a system. It determines the type of different fixed point. <br>\nIf the absolute value of the multiplier is greater than unity, it is a repellor and thus unstable. The fixed point is meta-stable. When the multiplier is less than unity an attractor exists.  Both satisfy the Schroeder functional equation, while when the multiplier is unity the the system satisfies the Abel functional equation. These are different symmetry conditions at the fixed point. Others exist like limit cycles from when the absolute value of the Lyapunov multiplier is a root of unity you end up with a limit cycle.<br>\nI would be remiss if I didn't touch of the application of CT to dynamics, particularly <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/11/01/categories_and_epidemiology/\">epidemiology</a>.</p>",

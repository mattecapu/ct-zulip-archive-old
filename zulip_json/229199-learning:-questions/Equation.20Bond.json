Such equations include ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic and probabilistic equations, discrete versions of all of the above, and all initial and boundary conditions. For example, if dx/dt(t)=f(x(t)) and y(0)=y_0, then identifying x with y converts the two previously unrelated equations into a single initial-value problem by \"bonding\" them along the identification of x with y. In other words, an equation bond constrains solutions of otherwise entirely independent equations. A solution to an equation bond consists of solutions to the equations which also satisfy the constraint. My question is, how would a categorist best explain \"equation bonds\" in general?</p>\n<p>For philosophical and biological context, see <a href=\"http://www.cognocity.org/circularchy/2021-CONTENTS-ZD.pdf\">http://www.cognocity.org/circularchy/2021-CONTENTS-ZD.pdf</a></p>",

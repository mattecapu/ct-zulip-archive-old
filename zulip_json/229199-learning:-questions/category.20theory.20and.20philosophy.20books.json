It looks very scientistic and reductionist,  reminiscent to the craziness of Peano arithmetic where you can use 50 lines to prove that 10 + 10 = 20. </p>\n<p>In the second period (eg. the Blue and Brown Books), this view was completely rejected by the new Wittgenstein who put more emphasis on the study of the language as it is spoken by people and making philosophy a study of the \"grammar\" of the language, ie. how people interact and act using it. For instance, he likes to analyse what's going on if imagine I ask somebody to fetch a red flower, what this person is going to do, eg. if he goes in a field to chose a  flower, how is he going to determine if a flower is in fact more orange or red etc... At Cambridge where he was professor, he liked to organize practical experiments about the language with its students. Instead of lectures, they could play to kind of games of language. </p>\n<p>For me, this view of the world trough language and actions resembles more to a categorical treatment of mathematics that the first one. Studying how people interact through the language is like studying how objects are in relations to each others through morphisms. </p>\n<p>The part of the philosophy of Wittgenstein which is identified as interesting for mathematics is the first one but I think it's no more true and Wittgenstein who died (in 1951) just after the invention of category theory (in 1945), and probably never knew them, through the progression of its philosophy, realized a change of paradigm akin to the one in mathematics.</p>",

Philosophy is a positive addition to mathematical study to the extent that it provides concepts and accompanying terminology for reasoning about the subject or its foundations. In the passages I read, Rosiak introduces pseudo-philosophical terminology for concepts which already are more than adequately described by the categorical language. I'm specifically thinking here of the description of functors which preserve certain limits as \"katholic\" in that they preserve the \"gatekeepers\" for certain diagrams (universal solutions). We already have names for those things, and as far as I can tell this does not provide a connection to an established term which might lend insight to a philosopher reading this passage. But I might have been unlucky with my sample.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It's a difficult question to answer and it took me some time to think to what I can say but I can say a few things.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Bourbaki has the flaw of being reductionist. Even if in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2305937\">The Architecture of Mathematics</a>, they present a more realistic view of mathematics, in their books you really have this feel of reductionism. Everything is said about a category before going to a particular subcategory. This is why the notion of real numbers comes only after thousands of pages. They study firstly all the concepts that appear in a characterization of the real numbers: the groups, the abelian groups, the rings, the orders, the topological spaces... and when they know everything about these terms they say that the real numbers are the only Archimedean ordered complete topological field or whatever, something like this. But structuralism is supposed to look at objects by the interaction they have with other objects in the structure and not to reduce the meaning of something to all of its components because the sum is more than the sum of the elements. And I think everybody will agree that you are not going to learn a lot about real numbers by studying first eg. abelian groups because the real numbers form an abelian group. Jean-Pierre Marquis says that other philosophers are wrong when they argue that the structuralism of Bourbaki is not a structuralism in the sense of human sciences but I think that they are in fact not so wrong. Although I don't know it precisely, structuralism looks like something much more refined that the philosophy that seems to appear when you look at the books of Bourbaki, even if the members where in fact more clever than the books and were submerged by their massive and rigid project. </p>\n<p>As to the influence of Bourbaki on school, I'm too young to say but I think it was strong. In the 60's or 70's important reforms on the school programs happened in France and I'm not sure if it is Dieudonné, Delsarte or a friend of Bourbaki who was part on the committee working on the math program. A lot of people have been traumatized by the very abstract programs of the time (eg. learning what is a bijection before learning calculus), and if they make some research about that, they can think it's because of Bourbaki but Bourbaki says that it's not their fault but because of how they have been interpreted etc... </p>\n<p>One has to say also that weirdly Bourbaki was not in favour of logic and I suppose that they were the kind of people employing the expression \"abstract nonsense\" for development which don't provide directly theorems (in classical fields) like proof theory or abstract categorical studies, although I'm not quite sure what was their opinion. But it seems that some members thought like this, probably not Grothendieck or Eilenberg, when you read The Architecture of Mathematics. I did my curriculum in France before moving to Canada at the end of my masters program and to start a PhD in one month, and this reflex of abstract nonsense is still spread among the mathematicians in the country. People are much more enthusiastic about classical mathematical subject than the abstract approaches eg. number theory and analysis are more popular that algebraic topology or very abstract functional analysis, as far as I know. And it's maybe the reason why France produce so much Field medalists, because a lot of people work on the very classical subjects and these are the subjects which interest the Field committee I guess.</p>\n<p>Compared to category theory, Bourbaki was all about maths and their goal was/is, as they always exist, even it's no more their golden age, to make a treatise on math. Category theory has less precise objectives and is open to other fields like computer science, physics, linguistic... And there is applied category theory but not really applied bourbakism. And category theory is a theory, not a book. So, I guess category theory is more open minded and people in category theory work on what appears on the path of the development of category theory, in a more experimental way. Thus it's more interesting and create more new theorems than Bourbaki but also takes way more time. But Bourbaki, with their imperfect philosophy did a great job for the formalization of mathematics and popularized such things as widely used as the symbols <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∀</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\forall</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∀</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∃</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\exists</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∃</span></span></span></span>. </p>\n<p>You can read the paper <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/MARFOS-4.pdf\">Forms of Structuralism: Bourbaki and the Philosophers</a>, by J.-P.

But in private we've been fiddling with the definitions of both so they are both subsumed under a single definition, since we had a gut feeling that it was a good idea. Mostly this involves making learners look more like games. In particular, almost all of the differences between the 2 papers arise from the fact that they're not talking about the differentiable structure that's in machine learning, they stick to Set (which in turn buys them some more generality to talk about other kinds of learners that don't use differentiation). Once you put the differentiable structure back into Backprop As Functor it <em>really</em> starts to look the same as open games - not that there's an adjunction or even an equivalence, but that they're literally the same category</p>",

That concept has a precise definition.   Mathematicians also use \"equivalent\" in a flexible, loose way where you say two things are equivalent if they're the same in any way you're interested in.   I think you are using equivalence in the second way.  In the second way, you have a lot of freedom in deciding what's equivalent to what: it depends on what you're doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That helps me understand the usages of the term <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> , thank you. I will continue my study to see how isomorphic objects can be seen as equivalent in the typical categorical sense of the term. I feel I'm starting to find that this is something you get a feel for with more practice. Most texts introduce the concept of isomorphism, but without an adjoining example of how isomorphims can be used, and how they should be appreciated. So I'm on the road to appreciating this property, and these comments have helped put things in perspective for me<span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

Then the caps and cups allow you to reverse the flow of information but without any other transformation, hence if you reverse it twice you get back the identity morphism.<br>\nAs you say, \"the morphisms between [motor/battery and Σ] amount to the identity morphisms\" in the following way: modulo some braiding, you could move the summation box to the right so that all of its input are fed directly from the left (via identity morphisms), and then if you use caps and cups to feed back the output of \"Σ\" to the \"Chassis\" box, you would get an equivalent diagram overall. Or you could flip Σ around 180 degrees (take its dual Σ*) and put it on top of the diagram, etc.</p>",

In category theory, two objects of the same category that are isomorphic in that category have all the same \"categorical properties\".  E.g. two isomorphic groups have all the same group-theoretical properties, so that group theorists speak of \"<em>the</em> cyclic group of order 3\" because such a group is unique up to isomorphism, even though strictly speaking there are many of them.</p>\n<p>The univalence axiom is an addition to the foundations of mathematics (which doesn't make sense if added to a ZFC-style foundation, but does make sense if added to a type-theoretic foundation) that eliminates the difference between equality and isomorphism for objects of such categories.  Under univalence, two isomorphic groups are in fact \"equal\", although this can be a misleading thing to hear at first because it arises by expanding the notion of \"equal\" so that it <em>means</em> \"isomorphic\", rather than somehow \"squashing\" or \"quotienting\" to force isomorphic groups to become equal in the original sense of \"equal\".  In particular, just as two groups can be isomorphic in more than one way, under univalence two groups can be <em>equal</em> in more than one way.</p>",

        "content": "<p>For the second question, we say that a statement or property is intenSional (not intenTional) if it depends on <em>how</em> things are defined, and extensional if it depends only on what those things are.  For instance, the morning star and the evening star are intensionally different, but extensionally equal (both being the planet Venus).  Mathematically, \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">4\\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">⋅</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">7</span></span></span></span>\" and \"the number of exotic 7-spheres\" are intensionally different, but extensionally equal.</p>\n<p>You may have heard these words used to describe type-theoretic foundations of mathematics.  In this case, for historical reasons, their use is extremely confusing and often almost \"backwards\" from what it ought to be.  In type-theoretic foundations, there are (at least) two different kinds of \"equality\": a \"judgmental\" equality and a \"typal\" (or, more traditionally, \"propositional\") equality.  The typal equality is the \"real\" equality of mathematics, which is usually extensional: \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">4\\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">⋅</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">7</span></span></span></span>\" and \"the number of exotic 7-spheres\" are typally equal.  (It's also the equality that is expanded by the univalence axiom to mean \"isomorphism\".)  To be sure, sometimes one considers type theories in which the typal equality is not fully determined, e.g. function extensionality may fail, so that it is not as extensional as it might be; but it is always at least somewhat extensional.</p>\n<p>The judgmental equality is <em>potentially</em> distinct from the typal equality, and thus potentially intensional.  One says that an \"intensional type theory\" is one in which the judgmental equality is truly intensional, whereas an \"extensional type theory\" is one in which the judgmental and typal equality coincide and are thus <em>both</em> extensional.  Unfortunately, this sometimes leads people to apply these adjectives to the typal equality itself and speak of an \"intensional equality type\" or an \"extensional equality type\", whereas in fact as I said the typal equality is <em>always</em> extensional (or at least aspires to be so) and the adjective really refers to the behavior of the <em>judgmental</em> equality.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the univalence axiom, which is an ultimate sort of <em>extensionality</em> property for the typal equality, is inconsistent with extensional type theory.  Thus, it is <em>intensional</em> type theory that can actually be \"more extensional\", at least in the behavior of its <em>typal</em> equality.</p>",

Can it be used to describe general relativity, as an example?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Topos theory is a framework for doing sheaf cohomology theory. So I will start by answering the question - why is sheaf cohomology useful?</p>\n<p>Some theorems in geometry that were proved using sheaf cohomology were Cartan's theorem A and B. More generally Cartan and Oka developed a powerful theory based on sheaf cohomology that was used to resolve many problems in several complex variables. </p>\n<p>This did not use Grothendieck topoi. Complex analytic manifolds are very nice spaces. Grothendieck invented topos theory to try and generalize  these methods to attack problems in algebraic geometry where the spaces are less nice. I am not a number theorist so I cannot explain the Weil conjectures to you (which were Grothendieck's direct motivation) but the Oka-Cartan theory seems like it is an accessible place to begin. The book \"Analytic functions of several complex variables\" by Gunning and Rossi describes this theory in whole. </p>\n<p>In algebraic geometry the paper \"Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents\" by Serre showed that these techniques could be used in algebraic geometry as well. Perhaps more relevant because this paper is more directly related to Grothendieck's work in topos theory.</p>",

Contrast this with 'linear algebra' (which is actually geometry) which studies thing invariant under linear transformations, 'affine geometry' which does the same thing with affine transformations, and so on. So topology is important in geometry insofar as it is a kind of geometry. There's also a lot of cross-pollination between various kinds of geometries, so topological ideas went to influence algebraic geometry and algebraic ideas went on to influence topology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of math has implications in the understanding of everything else <img alt=\":yo-dark:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/21514.png\" title=\"yo-dark\">, including mathematical phyiscs.

Contrast this with 'linear algebra' (which is actually geometry) which studies thing invariant under linear transformations, 'affine geometry' which does the same thing with affine transformations, and so on. So topology is important in geometry insofar as it is a kind of geometry. There's also a lot of cross-pollination between various kinds of geometries, so topological ideas went to influence algebraic geometry and algebraic ideas went on to influence topology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of math has implications in the understanding of everything else <img alt=\":yo-dark:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/21514.png\" title=\"yo-dark\">, including mathematical phyiscs.

General topology is more interested in properties that might fail for spaces considered by 'elementary analysis', like separability or connectedness or compactness. The most spectacular applications of topology arise from algebraic topology though, where one studies algebraic invariants attached to topological spaces. Be careful though, since most invariants actually  depends only on the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy%20type\">[[homotopy type]]</a> of a space, so on something even weaker than topology!</p>",

It's really fun to read his writing and he made it very precise and concise when building an example like this. I think what I'm doing here is like a 'categorical automata' that does category theory. First there are possible worlds that define a category as an objects with some properties, which includes a truth table, that the first row with a category and three properties: has arrow, has object, has arrows, has identity arrows. There's also equality, truth, false, and implications consisting of what's necessary for a truth table deductive inference, and proof techniques (are the proof techniques monads?) representing possible transformations from objects to objects. The automata is like a Turing machine (not sure if it fit into the definition of Turing machine exactly? I'm not a computer scientist, yet) going through objects and their properties and adding new arrows and erasing arrows (isomorphism, out of memory) and adding new properties (uniqueness) and erasing old properties (make it a category), where arrows indicates possible transformation of objects. The automata intuitively make the hypothesis that suppose there's something else (a distinction to be made here is that this is a proof by contradiction not a proof by negation, so hypothetical objects are okay, similar to proof by negation this is a 'proof by inverse' or 'proof by drawing arrows', the purpose of this is to find a 'hypothetical mapping', I suppose this has something to do with 'monads'?), if this is drawn on a paper it would be a branched out arrow pointing away from that new hypothetical object, and adding one tentative object on that table of categories, creating a new category and create a new possible mapping from that category, and commutativity of two arrows collapses the new object into one, making a new property of uniqueness of that initial object, and since it'a category one add this new object named as 'initial object'.</p>",

When you see the Pauli sigmas as vectors, then you can see the identity as expressing the simple geometric fact that three orthogonal vectors determine a unit volume. Thus there is geometric reason for the Pauli algebra, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with a spin. When I completed my little lecture on geometry of the Pauli algebra, my father gave me the greatest compliment of my life, which I remember to this day. He said, “You have learned the difference between a mathematical idea and its representation by symbols. Many mathematicians never learn that!” That really made me proud, because, actually, my father was very sparing with his compliments. So when he praised me, I knew I knew I had really done something good.” This is talking about semiotics in physics with geometry as semantics.</p>",

This includes a chapter called \"Towards a Semiotics of Mathematics\". I haven't read this, but it sounds relevant.</p>\n<p>I found this opening quote interesting:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/7NJihBA9rq98KczrOFmo7CbE/image.png\">semiotics intro</a> </p>\n<p>It feels to me that \"What is the nature of mathematical language?\" is one that comes up implicitly in the context of category theory quite a bit. In particular, I think the aim is often to figure out a language that makes mathematical thinking easier. For example, I remember seeing the argument that it's much more visually straightforward to prove some specific things using diagrams in 2D, as compared to using equations in 1D.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think he's advocating the process of iteratively building better algebraic structures by creating new, more succinct notations with deeper insight using the new distinctions drawn from geometry, combining the distinctions from the existing algebraic systems. In that paper, this process creates a Galois connection between the syntax space and the semantics space. But the distinction means that it's fuzzy in nature, mitigated only by new distinctions rather than definitions, as it will not fit into any existing algebraic structures. So I think this is where topos theory comes in. I don't know if topos theory has anything to do with Galois theory yet, but I don't think I'm talking about nonsense here.</p>",

For example, this can be formed by considering the closure dual interior operators of the lattice. I wonder if the same can be said for groups instead of lattices.

There's a lattice of subgroups of a group, and this is fundamental to Galois theory.  But I don't know what the \"least inclusive supergroup on a space that is weaker than a group locally\".

If a topological space is hausdorff and paracompact, then the cech cohmology coincides with sheaf cohomology. Why is the space required to be hausdorff? I am following the proof in Bredon's sheaf theory and it appears to me that the only  place where the paracompactness is used is in proposition 4.3. In this propositon, it is proved that every element in the čech cohomology is represented by an element in the čhech complex of an locally finite covering. So my question is, why is it required for the space to be hausdorff. Is it true in general, that the subcategory of locally finite open covering is a final subcategory of the category of open covering (seen as the poset category with the refinement relation) for a paracompact space <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span>?</p>",

But just to give a simple example, you may say that <br>\n\"A (small) category consists of a set of  objects, a set of morphisms, and some laws and axioms that must hold.\"<br>\nIn this case, you are considering the theory of sets as primitive, start from there and say what categories are. But there are also ways to axiomatize what categories are without resorting to set theory. Ad that point, you may say that<br>\n\"A set is a (small) category where there are only identity arrows. A function between set is a functor between such categories.\"<br>\nI put the \"small\" thing in parentheses because it's not important to focus on it right now.<br>\n...Here you are using category theory as primitive and defining set theory using that. Who comes first? Well, it depends on your point of view! The point is exactly that many concepts in category theory can be defined in multiple ways, that can be proved equivalent. Once you pick one, you can use it to define other concepts, or vice versa, a bit like in the example above</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Going back to a previous discussion. What about a type in HoTT? What's the difference between a type and a set? (and a category?)</p>",

For instance, the morning star and the evening star are intensionally different, but extensionally equal (both being the planet Venus).  Mathematically, \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">4\\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">⋅</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">7</span></span></span></span>\" and \"the number of exotic 7-spheres\" are intensionally different, but extensionally equal.</p>\n<p>You may have heard these words used to describe type-theoretic foundations of mathematics.  In this case, for historical reasons, their use is extremely confusing and often almost \"backwards\" from what it ought to be.  In type-theoretic foundations, there are (at least) two different kinds of \"equality\": a \"judgmental\" equality and a \"typal\" (or, more traditionally, \"propositional\") equality.  The typal equality is the \"real\" equality of mathematics, which is usually extensional: \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">4\\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">⋅</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">7</span></span></span></span>\" and \"the number of exotic 7-spheres\" are typally equal.  (It's also the equality that is expanded by the univalence axiom to mean \"isomorphism\".)  To be sure, sometimes one considers type theories in which the typal equality is not fully determined, e.g. function extensionality may fail, so that it is not as extensional as it might be; but it is always at least somewhat extensional.</p>\n<p>The judgmental equality is <em>potentially</em> distinct from the typal equality, and thus potentially intensional.  One says that an \"intensional type theory\" is one in which the judgmental equality is truly intensional, whereas an \"extensional type theory\" is one in which the judgmental and typal equality coincide and are thus <em>both</em> extensional.  Unfortunately, this sometimes leads people to apply these adjectives to the typal equality itself and speak of an \"intensional equality type\" or an \"extensional equality type\", whereas in fact as I said the typal equality is <em>always</em> extensional (or at least aspires to be so) and the adjective really refers to the behavior of the <em>judgmental</em> equality.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the univalence axiom, which is an ultimate sort of <em>extensionality</em> property for the typal equality, is inconsistent with extensional type theory.  Thus, it is <em>intensional</em> type theory that can actually be \"more extensional\", at least in the behavior of its <em>typal</em> equality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Revisiting another old discussion: Can the extensionality vs intensionality distinction mentioned in this paper of Judea Pearl <a href=\"https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r107-shrobe.pdf\">https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r107-shrobe.pdf</a> be understood in the same sense?</p>",

The only people who say this are people who have confused the meaning of a contravariant functor: saying this is the \"usual\" interpretation normalises incorrect usage. On the other hand, I think introducing both covariant and contravariant functors is needlessly confusing; in practice, people rarely talk about contravariant functors.</p>",

At the other extreme, with the degenerate Grothendieck topology (where every sieve is covering), the only sheaf is the terminal presheaf, where all objects are mapped to the singleton set.

        "content": "<p>How people approach research is partly a matter of how long they've been doing research, but there are things people can do just to get engaged and eventually sucked in (fascinated), which is a precondition for doing <em>significant</em> research, and many are things anyone can do at any stage of mathematical life. One is to seek out the really telling examples. Another is logical/analytical: if you have a theorem and its proof that you want to understand better, play little games like: could the hypotheses be weakened? Where do we use this hypothesis? What if I changed the hypotheses a little? Could the conclusion be strengthened? Is the converse true? </p>\n<p>In my own case, a lot of thinking is stimulated by a sense that something could be phrased better, or at least phrased in a way I find more satisfying. Even such a little thing as developing notation that I personally prefer helps me. Anything that creates a feeling of <em>doing something</em>, even if it's a little thing, helps. In short, making mathematics your own, even if it's in tiny ways, is vital. </p>\n<p>After you gain more experience, you can set yourself little challenges. You see a result stated. Not necessarily a big result, maybe a little lemma. But then don't look at the proof -- ask yourself: how might I prove this? Train yourself on little problems that naturally come your way, and develop a little independence. Don't google every damned thing, at least not before giving it the old college try yourself. </p>\n<p>If you're reading a proof of something you really want to know, go over and over it. Once you think you've got it clear and settled in your mind, write up a note about it, preferably without peeking back at the proof. </p>\n<p>Collect a bank of pictures and examples and lemmas. Oh, and <em>counterexamples</em>. Create over time your own personalized conceptual toolbox. </p>\n<p>Write for other people, or as if for other people. With the idea \"if I can understand this, then I can help others understand this\". </p>\n<p>If you have to break away from mathematics, try to end on a positive note. Some people (if they're writing) even stop mid-sentence, so that they can pick up right where they left off. </p>\n<p>This is all off the top of my head, and it's stuff most anyone can put into practice, no matter what stage of development they are.</p>",

What are the questions that can be interesting to ask in this case? </p>\n<p>In fact, I would be interested in hearing how generally people approach mathematical research. I did a statistics thesis but I felt like I was heavily reliant on my supervisor for intuition at that time, and get the sense of being dragged along throughout publishing that paper. I had a math degree but I felt like it was mostly me trying to pass the exams efficiently. What are the question that mathematicians ask themselves when they read a mathematical paper? I assume it isn't just about whether so and so is true, but instead we can ask what's the structure of these mathematical objects and what we can do about them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially it is a game like this. Define a relation between the known and the unknown and the random seed via an equation. Repeat independent experiments to collect known, in order to estimate the sets of the unknowns. Your data is the result of a certain relation between the random seed and the unknown parameter instead of \"following some distribution\". Is there anything in geometry around the lines of \"relational geometry\" or \"constructive geometry\"? Does this look like something that has to do with \"non-absolute space\" in physics? You don't start with a prescribed manifold, you construct a space from relations.</p>",

I always find myself severely underestimating the intricacy of small objects, thereby skipping important details and intuitions. What do you think about applications? Do you think about things happening in your everyday social life to be fruit for mathematically musing? Or is this helpful?</p>",

What I mean is that when it comes to conversations that include relatively sophisticated concepts like that of Riemannian manifold (normally not encountered until graduate school), both participants should really try their best to speak precisely, otherwise the conversation may not go far, or become frustrating for one or both parties.

I always find myself severely underestimating the intricacy of small objects, thereby skipping important details and intuitions. What do you think about applications? Do you think about things happening in your everyday social life to be fruit for mathematically musing? Or is this helpful?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"394227\">Peiyuan Zhu</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/beginner.20questions/near/284816875\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, how can a Riemanian manifold be constructed via causal / near causal relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really don't know how the \"in other words\" is supposed to be segueing from \"things happening in your everyday social life\" to Riemannian manifolds that are somehow constructed via causal / near causal relations. </p>\n<p>But since you asked how people do research, which includes two people trying to talk to one another in a context meant to be conducive to doing research, it may be that <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"275920\">John Baez</span>'s advice about learning definitions would be more useful here. What I mean is that when it comes to conversations that include relatively sophisticated concepts like that of Riemannian manifold (normally not encountered until graduate school), both participants should really try their best to speak precisely, otherwise the conversation may not go far, or become frustrating for one or both parties. Some sort of mutual understanding of how terms are defined quickly becomes vital here. </p>\n<p>So, I'm sorry, but I don't have much idea of what you're talking about, and I'm not that keen on trying to guess. Things in my everyday social life do not form a continuum of points. \"Causal relationship\" to me usually implies an asymmetry, and puts me more in mind of Lorentzian manifolds than Riemannian manifolds. Do you want to try again? (Of course, I may not be the best person to talk with here, but I'm okay with walking a few more steps.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh my bad the \"causal relation\" was meant to reply to my previous post. Just edited it. I'll try again.</p>",

What I mean is that when it comes to conversations that include relatively sophisticated concepts like that of Riemannian manifold (normally not encountered until graduate school), both participants should really try their best to speak precisely, otherwise the conversation may not go far, or become frustrating for one or both parties. Some sort of mutual understanding of how terms are defined quickly becomes vital here. </p>\n<p>So, I'm sorry, but I don't have much idea of what you're talking about, and I'm not that keen on trying to guess. Things in my everyday social life do not form a continuum of points. \"Causal relationship\" to me usually implies an asymmetry, and puts me more in mind of Lorentzian manifolds than Riemannian manifolds. Do you want to try again? (Of course, I may not be the best person to talk with here, but I'm okay with walking a few more steps.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll give you an example about what I mean by \"social life\".

        "content": "<p>I'd like to temporarily \"unresolve\" this just to point out that a lot of ideas underlying the connection were explored by Ross Street and Iain Aitchison around 40 years ago. In particular, lurking within Street's paper The Algebra of Oriented Simplexes is the combinatorics of associahedra, and the combinatorics of the polyhedral shapes associated with higher-order monoidal functors is lurking within a companion work The Geometry of Oriented Cubes by Aitchison. There are \"Aitchison-Pascal\" triangles which give rules for generating these polytopes. This is also connected with some old ideas of Dominic Verity for deriving parity structures on these polytopes in terms of some surface diagram theory he developed (and which I might be able to recall if I think enough about it). The PhD thesis of Sjoerd Crans is also relevant here, I believe. </p>\n<p>I have to apologize for being so vague here; the trouble is, I've forgotten a lot of how this works and I doubt I can lay my hands on those handwritten notes by Aitchison (who is no longer in academe) that displays his Pascal triangle and his recursive rules. But it seems worth pointing out in case someone wants to take up the thread, and mining some treasure troves of all but lost ideas. My suggestion would be to get in touch with Street, who is much more organized than I am and surely still has a copy of Aitchison's diagrams. Meanwhile, if you guys know about certain secret tunnels of the \"Russian underground\", a doi for one of Street's papers which describes some of these ideas is doi:10.1007/BF00872948 (I'd link to it directly, but I don't know how this Zulip feels about such links). </p>\n<p>So, it may be appropriate to mark this as unresolved after all, until I or someone else can revive the fading embers of such old thoughts...</p>",

There is also Christoph Dorn's thesis on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10586.pdf\">associative n-categories</a> that defines fully combinatorial models of higher categories, and conjectures that associative n-categories are the appropriate generalization of Gray categories. </p>\n<p>Nick Gurski has also suggested to me the idea of operadic methods for categorical coherence problems.

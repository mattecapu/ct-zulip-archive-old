But if I begin by thinking of the fundamentals then this process is much more interesting and less torturing. However as I'm not born into a mathematical physicist family so I'm quite far from those people who're actually working on the fundamentals and what they think can be quite distant, and I have a lot to learn in the process. But I think I can understand why John doesn't like vague questions because it's not a simple true / false judgement and the mathematical community somehow has to reinforce this like an immune system because mathematics would then lose what it has achieved so far. This is also why I like reading Jean-Pierre Aubin's book, including his criticism of Nicolas Bourbaki, although initially I found it too hard to understand because it's so different from the math textbooks that I'm used to in school, but later on as I pay attention to all the non-mathematical references in sociology, economics, biology that he used to explain math everything started to make a lot of sense to me.</p>",

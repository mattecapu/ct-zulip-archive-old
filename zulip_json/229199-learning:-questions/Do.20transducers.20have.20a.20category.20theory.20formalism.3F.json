I can't find an actual axiomatization in the documentation (e.g. something like Haskell's monad API with its monad laws), but based on <a href=\"https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/\">https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/</a> it seems like the author noticed that \"map followed by filter followed by fold\" fits the transducer pattern.</p>",

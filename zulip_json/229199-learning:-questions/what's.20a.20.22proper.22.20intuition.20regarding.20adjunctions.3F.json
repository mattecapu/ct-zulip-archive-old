I confess I was a bit lost in the analogy, and I was trying to come up with other examples of how to intuitively understand what's going on with adjunctions. At first, I thought adjunctions were like the Moore-Penrose inverse, where it's sort of a weaker version of how to invert a matrix... But it seems that this is not actually the case.<br>\nHence, my question is what are some good analogies/intuitions in order to understand adjuntcions?</p>",

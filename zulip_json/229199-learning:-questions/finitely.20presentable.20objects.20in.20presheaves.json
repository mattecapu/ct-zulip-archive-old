Jan: if you read the MathOverflow question (which I asked), and Tim Campion's initial response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hang on - this shows that X is a finite colimit of (finite colimits of representables) -- a \"2-fold\" finite colimit of representables. But how does one turn this into an actual finite colimit of representables?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then his later answer, it should help.</p>",

BTW he writes: \"Hom(x,-) commutes with colimits for x representable.\" Reading this, I have in mind something slightly different: that hom(x,-) preserves directed colimits. What's the difference between mine and his approach ? What does Djament mean by x representable ? There is yet a third possiiblity that x is a hom-functor but now we have already hom outside x.</p>",

A dagger-matrix is a matrix (of sets) equipped with an isomorphism to its transpose.  Unfortunately any dagger-matrix must be square, so the bicategory of dagger-matrices is just a disjoint union of monoidal categories.  It gets a little more interesting when you beef it up to a double category, but the lack of non-endo profunctors makes it hard to do any of the formal category theory that you can usually do with monads in a bicategory or double category.</p>",

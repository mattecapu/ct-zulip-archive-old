There was a practice problem in the text book that went like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create an olog for human nuclear biological families that includes the concepts of person, man, woman, parent, father, mother, and child. Make sure to label all the arrows and that each arrow indicates a valid aspect in the sense of Section 2.3.2.1. Indicate with check marks the diagrams that are intended to commute. If the 2-dimensionality of the page prevents a check mark from being unambiguous, indicate the intended commutativity with an equation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For an initial first pass, I left out the check marks but came up with this diagram. <a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/NZ1zUN0fbZWySPoZPtZzl7gQ/family_olog.png\">family_olog.png</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/NZ1zUN0fbZWySPoZPtZzl7gQ/family_olog.png\" title=\"family_olog.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/NZ1zUN0fbZWySPoZPtZzl7gQ/family_olog.png\"></a></div>",

Even though \"has a\" often functions as a marker of a function in natural language, you always need to be sure the usage is unique. Since many children have two (or more) parents, this relation isn't a function. </p>\n<p>I think that might be the reason it felt natural to put both the mother and the father in the same box further down the line.</p>",

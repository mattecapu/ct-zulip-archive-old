Every once in a while I try to learn about them in synthetic differential geometry, because I'm told that it is conceptually much simpler and I'm interested in synthetic techniques.</p>\n<p>I found a definition in <a href=\"https://users-math.au.dk/kock/SGM-final.pdf\">Anders Kock's \"Synthetic Geometry on Manifolds\"</a> that is very conceptually appealing (Definition 3.1.1 on page 93): a differential k-form on a manifold M with values in a vector space W is just a function from infinitesimal k-simplices in M to W that is 0 if any two vertices of the simplex are equal. Here an infinitesimal k-simplex is a function from \"the\" infinitesimal k-simplex, i.e., the set of tuples of k points in R that are pair-wise infinitesimally close to each other. This seems like a very natural definition since it is basically literally an infinitesimal notion of volume.</p>\n<p>But I don't understand why this definition implies automatically that any differential form is <em>alternating</em> (Theorem 3.1.5) i.e., that if I swap two vertices of a simplex that that reverses the sign of the value of the form. I tried to follow the proof and it came down to something called the \"Taylor principle\" (page 29) that I didn't quite grasp. When I learned about differential forms analytically, the alternating was motivated by the fact that we were talking about <em>oriented</em> volume and so swapping arguments meant changing the orientation, but I am very curious why the orientedness seems to be an inevitable consequence of the notion of infinitesimal volume? Maybe someone could help me with the infinitesimal geometric intuition here?</p>",

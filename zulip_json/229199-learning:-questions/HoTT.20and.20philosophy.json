I would argue that in some ways, Book HoTT is better for gaining intuitions than cubical type theory, because in cubical type theory you have to worry about this additional weird \"interval\" thing that is kind of a type and kind of not a type.  So I would recommend a proof assistant for Book HoTT, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/\">HoTT Coq library</a> or one of the Agda HoTT libraries, at least as much as cubical agda to a newcomer.

His book also points to limitations in modal logic and future work along those lines.</p>\n<p>As a software engineer I am particularly interested in the computational power HoTT as it brings the promise to be able to take proofs on simple models and have them translated nearly automatically to more complex models. Eg. Numers with just the successor function and binary numbers that are much more efficient. The last lectures of the Cubical Hott course look at that.  But apparently one cannot yet translate cubical Agda programs to Haskell (or I'd love it if it could be Scala, or if one could just program directly in it)...</p>",

        "content": "<p>By the way, I think one could argue that for almost all objects in mathematics it is enough to know their universal property. After all, in homotopy type theory, the main way to construct types is as (higher) inductive types and such types are introduced via their universal property. For instance, all there is to know about the natural numbers is that they satisfy the Peano axioms, and roughly speaking the Peano axioms are more or less equivalent to \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb N</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span></span></span></span> is a natural numbers object\" (I think), which can be thought of as the universal property of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb N</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span></span></span></span>. Of course, one reason my question is inherently vague is that I don't specify in which category the universal properties I'm discussing should be phrased. My original post probably suggests that I'm talking about universal properties in categories of groups, rings, and so on. On the other hand, the universal properties that can be derived from definitions of types as inductive types are universal properties in categories of algebras over endofunctors on the category of types (or something like that).</p>",

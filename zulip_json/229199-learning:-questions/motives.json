I like it.)</p>\n<p>The first part of the question was whether you can restate the Riemann hypothesis part of the Weil conjectures directly in terms of a formula for the number of points of a variety.  The second part was whether the summands in my guessed formula correspond to motives.     The answers were \"yes\" and \"yes\".</p>",

I.e., I normally think about it in terms of force producing a change in momentum for a specific object. But another way of thinking about it is that it measures the flow of momentum. This became clear to me when I derived the pressure of an ideal gas by calculating the momentum flow into its boundary from collisions by particles.</p>\n<p>Two gases that are at equilibrium because they have matched pressures have a balanced equilibrium of momentum flowing in to each other.</p>\n<p>I feel like there is an essentially \"open\" quality to analysis of flow like this that is absent from the \"closed\" perspective of Hamiltonian mechanics, and I would like to understand how to bring this kind of thing into the more general setting of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>",

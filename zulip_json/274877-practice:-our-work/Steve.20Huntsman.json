(FWIW, arXiv seemed to really get wrapped around the axle about the \"advertisement\" and/or \"rant\" language: HAL is much more permissive with that and using PDFs instead of killing yourself with LaTeX wrangling). </p>\n<p>I won't be talking about more concrete applications of magnitude to various problems in optimization, but some of these are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11677\">here</a> , <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3520304.3534006\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10037\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I will be missing the ACT days and most of the rest too, but also won't be representing my employer when I am around, so if anyone wants to give me a piece of their mind (in exchange for a piece of mine) they are most welcome.</p>",

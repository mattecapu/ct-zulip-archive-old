Our current project is an exploration of what factorization systems for geometric morphisms look like in this special case. We have most of a paper on the \"Root\" of a monoid tucked away too, which we should eventually get around to finishing.</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"284376\">Riccardo Zanfa</span>, work on (Street) fibrations, especially between categories with pullbacks and toposes. That work may depend on...</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276092\">Nathanael Arkor</span>, a small project on free cocompletions of (internal) categories with respect to manageable classes of colimit.</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276037\">Jade Master</span>, a (currently dormant) investigation of whether or not the category of symmetric monoidal categories is monadic over the category of Petri nets, and more generally whether the category of Q-categories is monadic over the category of Q-nets for a Lawvere theory Q.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The third entry above will help me understand the right construction of syntactic categories for <strong>supercompactly generated theories</strong>, which is what I'm calling theories classified by supercompactly generated toposes. While it's of course possible to express these as geometric theories, the canonical sites for supercompactly generated toposes are <em>reductive sites</em>, which are characterized by the existence of particular colimits, and I would like to develop a standalone syntax for such categories.</li>\n<li>Whatever the outcome of the preceding point, I want to extract a characterization of theories classified by toposes of topological monoid actions. This will be the key step in making <strong>Topological Semi-Galois Theory</strong>, the analogue of Galois Theory with monoids in place of groups, a viable tool.</li>\n<li>The final thing I'm hoping to get done before my PhD ends (in October <span aria-label=\"dizzy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f635\" role=\"img\" title=\"dizzy\">:dizzy:</span> ) is to establish what the semi-Galois analogue of the classical Galois theory of field extensions should be. I already have some idea of what this will look like, but I need to do a lot more work to clarify the picture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond the end of my PhD... It's clear that some of the work above is going to have to take place after my PhD ends. If you happen to be or know someone who can offer me a post-doc position where any of the above would be relevant, then please get in touch <span aria-label=\"stuck out tongue wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61c\" role=\"img\" title=\"stuck out tongue wink\">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span> .</p>",

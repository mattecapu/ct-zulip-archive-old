Our current project is an exploration of what factorization systems for geometric morphisms look like in this special case. We have most of a paper on the \"Root\" of a monoid tucked away too, which we should eventually get around to finishing.</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"284376\">Riccardo Zanfa</span>, work on (Street) fibrations, especially between categories with pullbacks and toposes. That work may depend on...</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276092\">Nathanael Arkor</span>, a small project on free cocompletions of (internal) categories with respect to manageable classes of colimit.</li>\n<li>With <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276037\">Jade Master</span>, a (currently dormant) investigation of whether or not the category of symmetric monoidal categories is monadic over the category of Petri nets, and more generally whether the category of Q-categories is monadic over the category of Q-nets for a Lawvere theory Q.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The third entry above will help me understand the right construction of syntactic categories for <strong>supercompactly generated theories</strong>, which is what I'm calling theories classified by supercompactly generated toposes. While it's of course possible to express these as geometric theories, the canonical sites for supercompactly generated toposes are <em>reductive sites</em>, which are characterized by the existence of particular colimits, and I would like to develop a standalone syntax for such categories.</li>\n<li>Whatever the outcome of the preceding point, I want to extract a characterization of theories classified by toposes of topological monoid actions. This will be the key step in making <strong>Topological Semi-Galois Theory</strong>, the analogue of Galois Theory with monoids in place of groups, a viable tool.</li>\n<li>The final thing I'm hoping to get done before my PhD ends (in October <span aria-label=\"dizzy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f635\" role=\"img\" title=\"dizzy\">:dizzy:</span> ) is to establish what the semi-Galois analogue of the classical Galois theory of field extensions should be. I already have some idea of what this will look like, but I need to do a lot more work to clarify the picture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond the end of my PhD... It's clear that some of the work above is going to have to take place after my PhD ends. If you happen to be or know someone who can offer me a post-doc position where any of the above would be relevant, then please get in touch <span aria-label=\"stuck out tongue wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61c\" role=\"img\" title=\"stuck out tongue wink\">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span> .</p>",

My advisor gave me an example of a machine that can perform computations on graphs efficiently; more generally, the speed at which a computer can perform certain computations on some data structure depends on how that structure is loaded into the machine, and encoding a graph on the tape of a Turing machine is hard to do efficiently. The claim is that the improvement in efficiency will only be polynomial.</p>\n<p>Of course, for this to be true one also needs to control which operations count as basic. Beta-reductions in lambda calculus are <a href=\"https://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/israccattoli.pdf\">a bit too powerful</a>, for instance.</p>",

And in the first community, the model of choice is Turing machines, whereas in the second community, it is RAMs.</p>\n<p>However, as I said, most complexity classes of interest in complexity theory are model-invariant, or, even better, have equivalent definitions which do not mention any model at all (see for example <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Descriptive_complexity_theory\">descriptive complexity theory</a>).  Turing machines are just a convenient choice motivated by the fact that their time and space cost models are self-evident and essentially unquestionable, but they are not inevitable for formulating complexity theory.  Here, categorical approaches are definitely possible and, hopefully, relevant (I hope to be able to say something more precise soon!).</p>\n<p>In the case of algorithms, there is no hope: precise running times (e.g., up to the exponent in a polynomial bound) depend on the model.  We are especially interested in how algorithms behave on the computational devices we use every day, and so we tend to pick models that are close to them.  In any case, it is possible to develop categorical approaches to both the languages describing algorithms and the relationship that these have with the cost models of interest.  The first aspect is, basically, modern programming languages theory <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span> (and you know more than me about it!).  The second aspect is less developed, and certainly more of a present-day challenge, but there is already interesting work on the topic.  A couple of examples that come to my mind now are Blelloch and Harper's approach to time and space cost models in functional programming languages (although it does not explicitly use any category theory) and Danner and Licata's papers on denotational cost semantics (which uses monads!).  But there's certainly more out there.</p>",

(Hopefully I am remembering this right). How sparse a vector is depends on the basis that we choose, which reminds me of your section entitled \"fragility of complexity measures\".</p>\n<p>We can use sparsity to help solve optimization problems, where the intuition is that the real solution is \"simple\", which we approximate by saying it should be pretty sparse with respect to a chosen basis. A challenge here is choosing a basis that makes the unknown solution actually sparse. It's my guess that people are using machine learning these days to find sparsifying basis vectors. Anyways, this approach can help reject \"artifacts\" in images, and reduce the impact of noise - intuitively because these additions to an image make them less simple.</p>\n<p>Do you happen to know if the sparsity of a vector with respect to a basis is somehow related to the kind of complexity you are talking about?</p>\n<p>Edit: Upon reading a little more carefully, I see you talk about the squared length of vectors in a given basis as an example of how we can vary complexity by changing the building blocks involved. The example of sparsity is a little different, but very similar, so I think I understand that sparsity probably does fit under the umbrella of the things you're talking about here. Cool!</p>",

It's really interesting to hear someone studying the dual problem of choosing a complexity measure out of a particular family which makes the chosen instance simple. For a single vector, the problem is less interesting, but for simultaneously making a whole family of vectors as sparse as possible I imagine it gets difficult fast. <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>",

If ever someone care about little picky historical details. I've already seen a preprint where they mention my phd project without telling my name in a cunning way and I thought it lacks of such a precision that is surprising given that math is supposed to be the field of human knowledge with the highest standard of rigour. Surprisingly, the same exact kind of oversight appeared a second time on Mastodon last time! I'm interested to see if it happens a third time <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span>. (sorry for this message, I just think it could be fair to mention that I started this discussion and at the end I just want to get a job one day). I think you said one time that you are interested by ethics so think to what is the best to do here. I think that there is some value in asking the questions in math even if you don't answer them or even if it's just to point out something interesting with a simple question. It was a simple question but it started your further discussions and all the process and then your idea of making a paper. I don't know what is the best to do in such case to explain the story. Maybe simply say how things happened in the simplest way: \"A discussion started when ... asked about noncommutative idempotent rigs and then we became interested by the free idempotent rig to answer this question and understand more about these objects... \". That's an editorial suggestion. If you think it's ethically better not to mention my name, then it would then be the best thing to do of course. I'm not so much knowledgeable in ethics so I can't say and I'm seeking for your help on this point.</p>",

If you are stack-minded, this is saying something about how one can give finite-dimensional Lie groupoid presentations of differentiable stacks over a manifold, of a certain sort.</p>\n<p>A nice corollary is that no smooth 2-group extension of a compact simple connected Lie group (not necessarily simply-connected) can be topologically nontrivial and given by a finite-dimensional crossed

This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier,for instance in physics applications. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern–Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure,can be rigidified—it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense,from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction.Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"message_inline_ref\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uwfmotydjv1hjed/paperI.pdf?dl=0\" title=\"paperI.pdf\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/4e6a42a0ea7686feb2e70442a53be9c49b21cc6a/68747470733a2f2f7777772e64726f70626f782e636f6d2f7374617469632f6d6574617365727665722f7374617469632f696d616765732f737065637472756d2d69636f6e732f67656e6572617465642f636f6e74656e742f636f6e74656e742d7064662d6c617267652e706e67\"></a><div><div class=\"message_inline_image_title\">paperI.pdf</div><desc class=\"message_inline_image_desc\"></desc></div></div>",

And so every bundle 2-gerbe is stably isomorphic to one that is a) a pullback of the universal one and b) this has a rigidification in the sense of the paper. One thing which I'm pretty certain is true is that given a smooth manifold X, we should be able to find a rigid bundle 2-gerbe built out of <em>manifolds</em> on X that is stably-isomorphic to any pullback of the universal rigid bundle 2-gerbe (which is diffeological) along X -&gt; K(Z,4). This is a paper II problem, however.</p>",

I was thinking some more on your question:</p>\n<p>So for my research, I have been working in the domain of observational health research which uses as a data source, retrospective data like patient medical claims, electronic health records, etc. A couple significant components to this research has been 1) Structuring this data in a meaningful and standardized way 2) Developing definitions of disease using a variety of medical ontologies  and 3) Extracting patient cohorts from this data based on 1 and 2 to draw potential conclusions in the context of retrospective studies. 1 has been somewhat solved in my space thanks to a format known as the OMOP Common Data Model which has been adopted internationally for working with this sort of data. 2 and 3 are very much an open questions that I am exploring and working on.</p>",

Some things that I have been openly exploring within intersecting observational health research and category theory are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describing disease definitions using pullbacks into different medical ontologies to reconstruct disease definitions across different studies</li>\n<li>Exploring the use of ontology logs to describe patients matching to a specific disease definition (began to more rigorously explore this thought here: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145\">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145</a>) </li>\n<li>Thinking around CatLab with how I could use a combination of ACSets and Directed Wiring Diagrams to represent my study and chain my work together with other collaborators I work with</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I apologize if the above sounds entirely inane or puerile but I can't help but feel there is something here when approached from a category theory sense. For me, disease definitions boil down in some cases to sets and family of sets that work very well within the category of <strong>Set</strong>, there feels to be a relationship I can develop between disease definitions and the medical ontologies that were used, and I would love to someday have the ability to treat a given observational study as almost \"filters\" (in a signal processing sense) to create novel studies on patients (e.g. say a study A exists that characterizes depression across age group and race and a study B that characterizes sexual minorities, it would be so cool to compose A and B together to create a study C that characterizes depression across sexual minorities' age group and race).</p>",

I'll be leaving Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control soon and relocate to Boston sometime this summer to begin my studies later this Fall.

I've been trying to prepare my brain to think more like a mathematician and gain fundamental skills mathematicians should have. I've had some background in maths due to my engineering training (partial and ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, SIR modeling, calculus, etc.) but not from the unique mathematician point of view.

I was thinking some more on your question:</p>\n<p>So for my research, I have been working in the domain of observational health research which uses as a data source, retrospective data like patient medical claims, electronic health records, etc. A couple significant components to this research has been 1) Structuring this data in a meaningful and standardized way 2) Developing definitions of disease using a variety of medical ontologies  and 3) Extracting patient cohorts from this data based on 1 and 2 to draw potential conclusions in the context of retrospective studies. 1 has been somewhat solved in my space thanks to a format known as the OMOP Common Data Model which has been adopted internationally for working with this sort of data. 2 and 3 are very much an open questions that I am exploring and working on.</p>",

        "content": "<p>In truth, I am still very nascent in my understandings of category theory and am openly exploring how category theory could be used in work such as this. Some things that I have been openly exploring within intersecting observational health research and category theory are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describing disease definitions using pullbacks into different medical ontologies to reconstruct disease definitions across different studies</li>\n<li>Exploring the use of ontology logs to describe patients matching to a specific disease definition (began to more rigorously explore this thought here: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145\">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145</a>) </li>\n<li>Thinking around CatLab with how I could use a combination of ACSets and Directed Wiring Diagrams to represent my study and chain my work together with other collaborators I work with</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I apologize if the above sounds entirely inane or puerile but I can't help but feel there is something here when approached from a category theory sense. For me, disease definitions boil down in some cases to sets and family of sets that work very well within the category of <strong>Set</strong>, there feels to be a relationship I can develop between disease definitions and the medical ontologies that were used, and I would love to someday have the ability to treat a given observational study as almost \"filters\" (in a signal processing sense) to create novel studies on patients (e.g. say a study A exists that characterizes depression across age group and race and a study B that characterizes sexual minorities, it would be so cool to compose A and B together to create a study C that characterizes depression across sexual minorities' age group and race).</p>",

After fifty years of lone research, I'm now working with others and it is really improving the quality of my work. I just learned about the politics of convergence proofs from Yiannis Galidakis who alerted me about it in analytic continuation. People don't want to see innovative convergence proofs, they want to deal with convergence proofs like they have dealt with before and that means analytic continuation. My recent good news is functional equation are usually used in analytic continuation and I know the functional equations that describe the continuations.</p>",

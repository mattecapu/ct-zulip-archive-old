See our first paper on the topic<br>\n<a href=\"https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~pierrepradic/aperiodic.pdf\">https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~pierrepradic/aperiodic.pdf</a><br>\nfor a brief introduction to the perspective we've been developing, or Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis defended last year<br>\n<a href=\"https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf\">https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf</a><br>\nfor a more lengthy overview of this research programme. (In fact the result I'm announcing here positively answers Conjecture 1.4.3 in my thesis.)</p>",

Out of those 4 days, around 1.5 days was spent on discovering the 2-dimensional syntax for relations described in <a href=\"https://richardblute.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/williams-novfest.mp4\">Christian's talk</a>. Every time I introduced a new piece of syntax, we spent a lot of time finding examples and asking simple questions before moving on, and by the end of the week, we were able to cover relations, composition of relations, implications, vertical and horizontal composition of implications. I am not sure what to think of the end result. On the one hand, he and I had fun exploring these ideas and I believe the graphical syntax definitely helped him throughout our work. On the other hand, on the last day, he was supposed to prepare a quick explanation of what he did during the week to share with other students who did a similar internship, but he told me he was not confident enough in his understanding of relations, so we switched to a more <strong>concrete</strong> subject.</p>\n<p>Let me give a bit more details. It was really hard for him to find examples and questions by himself. I think the main problem is that he is not used to abstract reasoning, and I think I was bad at pointing out the relevant patterns. For instance, whenever we dealt with composition of two relations, he had to draw the points in the colors and links between them before understanding (that's I think the main good point about the syntax: the points and links picture for a relation embeds well in the syntax). This was easier when dealing with relations between a set and itself, in particular, familial relationships (dad, cousin, grandparent, etc.) between humans and the usual orders on integers. I found he was not very enthusiastic about our findings, so I'd like to look for better examples of things to prove (for me, the best thing we have proved is that if a relation is reflexive, then it is dense, we had lots of examples of dense and non-dense relations and we figured out all dense ones were reflexive, so we showed the implication (very easily) graphically).</p>\n<p>TLDR: Teaching relations to a high school student is very hard, but I believe it is less hard when using a graphical syntax.</p>",

I am interested in roughly the following categories to describe classical, pure-quantum and mixed-quantum \"probability theories\" respectively:<br>\na) Objects are measurable spaces, morphisms are substochastic transition kernels (i.e. transitions are allowed to \"lose probability mass\"),<br>\nb) Objects are Hilbert spaces, morphisms are linear operators with Hilbert-Schmidt norm <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\leq 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≤</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span> (i.e. operators are allowed to \"lose amplitude\"/get the system into a not-further-considered state with a certain probability),<br>\nc) Objects are <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>C</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">C^*</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-algebras with trace operators, morphisms are completely positive maps that don't increase the trace when acting on nonnegative operators.</p>\n<p>My question: What are there literature name of these objects that I should use and (where) can I find a textbook-style discussion? I am particularly interested in whether/how one can define tensor products/direct sums. When I google around, I find scattered references to what seem to be things like that, but no unified treatment, and mostly in papers/blogposts.</p>\n<p>In the next step, I'd like to do something with these categories (more specifically, construct the \"states of knowledge\" I am <a href=\"https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/08/convex-knowledge/\">interested in</a> in a more abstract way than I am currently doing). But that's separate from finding a definition of these categories in the first place.</p>\n<p>To the extent that allowing infinite-dimensional spaces makes things more complicated, I am only interested in the finite dimensional case.</p>",

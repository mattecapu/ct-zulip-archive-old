A first (unsatisfactory) answer is that you can embed the category of stochastic maps into that of linear maps with the tensor as monoidal product, which is traced, at least in the finite-dimensional case---I'll let people that are knowledgeable in functional analysis tell us how to generalise this to infinite dimensions. But I suppose the (partial) trace of a stochastic map might not be stochastic, which is why I said that was unsatisfactory.</p>",

Getting the product of measurable spaces (I.e. only the data of the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebras) is ok, but the first resources I've been looking at have been relying on a general result about extending a pre-measure like the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem or Carathéodory's extension theorem. Is there a cleaner proof in the case of forming a product space? Obviously we can't get away from analysis completely, since we need to use completeness of the reals somewhere, I presume.</p>",

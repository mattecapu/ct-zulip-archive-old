Both definitions use the principle of \"inductive-inductive\" definitions as well. I wonder: Is this really an application of <em>higher</em> inductive types? After all, both definitions contain only point and path constructors, but not any homotopy constructors. So would both definitions also work in, say, a type theory with a notion of \"quotient type\" and inductive-inductive definitions?<br>\nAlso, aren't Theorem 11.3.9 and Corollary 11.6.5 (stating that these types are sets) trivial in some sense, because both definitions contain only point and path constructors, but not any homotopy constructors?<br>\nThe introduction to chapter 6 gives an explanation of the phenomenon of an inductive type being a higher groupoid while being defined only using point and path constructors: if the domain of some constructor has higher paths, these will carry over. But if all domains of all constructors are sets, I believe this can't happen. Do Theorem 11.3.9 and Corollary 11.6.5 also fall in some class of higher inductive types that yield sets \"for trivial reasons\"?</p>",

That is, consider a higher inductive type <code>T</code> generated from constructors <code>point : P → T</code> and <code>path : (x y : P) → R x y → point x = point y</code>, where <code>P : Set</code> and <code>R : P → P → Prop</code>. Then, if <code>R</code> is cycle-free in some suitable graph-theoretic sense, <code>T</code> will be a set. The circle fails the latter condition in the simplest way possible – the whole idea of the circle is that the path forms a cycle.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate a reference, if anyone knows one, because it's not immediately clear to me how it works when <code>P</code> has large cardinality and cycle-free paths can be infinitely long.</p>",

Seven Sketches of Compositionality, the book I’m working with, does not provide definitions of sets or logical concepts, beyond “a collection of things”.</p>\n<p>But my early attempt would be something like this (maybe to come, in Python).</p>\n<p>We could take the Python set object as the mathematical concept of a set. To add structure we can define new classes.</p>\n<p>What might a list of definitions look like?</p>\n<p>We probably need products and subsets next?</p>\n<p>Products are tuples in Python.</p>\n<p>A subset is a set, the parent / superset set, and the “subset function” that tests the truth condition “is subset”: so its signature is actually a triple, A, B, f. Right? def subset(A, B): condition = False; for element in B: if element not in A: condition = False; return condition</p>\n<p>I imagine there’s a more pythonic way using a list processing method like a map or filter or something.</p>\n<p>And then? I’ll see what is needed next. I know a relation is actually a subset of a product set. A function is a relation with a certain condition expressed in logical quantifiers, I think? two sets A B, for each b in B, there exists one and only one a in A such that the tuple in the subset of the product set of A and B has b in second place.</p>\n<p>So we skipped over sets and logic, but it doesn’t matter since we already roughly have it in Python. We define a preorder as a binary relation which is reflexive and transitive. Like subsets, perhaps, all concepts can be defined as a signature of objects <em>and</em> functions they have to pass - their conditions?</p>",

I have not read this book, but \"Naive Set Theory\" by Halmos looks like it might be a reasonable starting point.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the very start of that book says this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing that the development will not include is a definition of sets. The situation is analogous to the familiar axiomatic approach to elementary geometry. That approach does not offer a definition of points and lines; instead it describes what it is that one can do with those objects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, the author then goes on to talk about how sets can \"have elements\", and how sets can \"be equal\", and that the axiom of extensionality says that two sets are equal exactly when they have all the same elements. So, one can begin to work with sets without really defining what a set itself is.</p>",

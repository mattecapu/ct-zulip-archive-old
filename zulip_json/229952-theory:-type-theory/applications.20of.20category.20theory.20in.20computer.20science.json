One can put bells and whistles on it, but the basic model of Spivak's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1166\">functorial data migration</a> is pleasingly simple: database schemas are finitely presented categories and database instances are set-valued functors (copresheaves) on the schema. With this setup, there is a dictionary between many standard CT and database concepts.</p>",

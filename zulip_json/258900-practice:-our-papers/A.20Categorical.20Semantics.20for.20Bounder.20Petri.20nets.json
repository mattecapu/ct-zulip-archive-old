Me, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"282822\">@fosco</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281862\">@Daniele Palombi</span> have a new paper out. This is related to the paper about mana-nets that we released last week (discussed here: #<strong>#</strong>practice: our papers&gt;Nets with Mana: A Framework for Chemical Reaction Modelling** ),  and it's part of a bigger effort in categorizing extensions of Petri nets using fibrations and lax functors.</p>\n<p>You can find the arXiv here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09100\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09100</a><br>\nIf you don't like to read, I've also made a video presentation here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4dyTNgz60\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4dyTNgz60</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"mv4dyTNgz60\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4dyTNgz60\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mv4dyTNgz60/default.jpg\"></a></div><p>On the YT channel you will also find videos of other papers conceptually related to this one. Any feedback is appreciated! By the way, next week we will release yet another paper about hierarchic nets, so if Petri nets are your thing, stay tuned! <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

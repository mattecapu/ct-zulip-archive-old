The way we do it in this paper, it is useful to be familiar with how the syntax of a programming language is presented via BNF/grammars.

Finally, exposure to some basic algebra of datatypes (which may come from Haskell for instance, but also from a basic course on groups/monoids etc.)</p>",

You explain the idea in Remark 2.13, but I would also like several simple examples like proving that left unitality + commutativity implies right unitality in the theory of commutative monoids. Carefully expliciting alI the steps and possibly comparing them to the steps in the  derivation using equational reasoning could help. Even in that simple proof, the sliding of the unit has raised questions when I showed it once because of the invisible wire. I think it would be nice to have 1 or 2 more examples.</li>\n<li>I would like the software list to also have typesetting software/libraries.</li>\n</ul>",

These tend to arise in topics that historically were called \"cybernetics\" (before that term drifted beyond recognition) - AI, control theory, game theory, systems theory. Specific examples of \"things that compose optically\" are derivatives (well known as backprop), exact and approximate Bayesian inverses, payoffs in game theory, values in control theory and reinforcement learning, updates of data (the original setting for lenses), and updates of state machines. I'll do a gentle tour through these, emphasising their shared structure and the field we're developing to study it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

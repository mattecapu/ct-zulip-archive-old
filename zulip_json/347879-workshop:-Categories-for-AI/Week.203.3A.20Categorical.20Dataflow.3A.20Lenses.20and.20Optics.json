We'll take a look at monoidal categories, cartesian categories, lenses and optics, and see how these constructions help us understand various computation patterns happening inside neural networks. </p>\n<p>Here's some last minute information (also communicated in the Google groups email.)</p>\n<p>The lecture starts in little over 3 hours (at 4PM UK time) at the following Zoom link: <a href=\"https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/83816139841\">https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/83816139841</a> As before, it will be streamed to Youtube (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4iRU4pBkCo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4iRU4pBkCo</a>) and recorded.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"p4iRU4pBkCo\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4iRU4pBkCo\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/384d4ffded355859cf9fa0bcb1421aa6e065b5cb/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f70346952553470426b436f2f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p>The lecture is expected to last up to 2 hours (including Q&amp;A).

Hence, the event will last <strong>4--6pm UK Time</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is to give us ample time to play with many interesting categorical constructs in a paced manner. If you cannot make the whole slot, this is okay -- we will again strive to record. Of course, being there for the live event is preferable, as it will allow you to ask questions on the spot. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

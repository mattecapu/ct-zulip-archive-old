I have found most written diagram chasing proofs to be a big hassle to read because a single big diagram is drawn and you must visualize which parts are drawn at each step of the proof. My idea to solve this would be to have a diagram for each step and indicators in the text to see which diagrams the reader should look at. Obviously, this demands more work from the writer because they have to edit a diagram for each step. Thus, I was thinking that within quiver, there could be a way to put every part of the diagram (objects and arrows) into groups and then quiver generates a diagram for each group displaying only the parts within that group. This way, one could draw the whole diagram on quiver, select the parts of the diagram that should be displayed at step 1,2,etc. and quiver generates a diagram for step 1,2,etc. automatically.</p>\n<p>A better way (imo) to display this would be to have a slideshow instead of many diagrams and inside the text, there are indicators to tell you when to move to the next step. This would be very hard to implement on a pdf I guess, but that could be done as an extension of the embedding capabilities quiver already has in webpages.</p>",

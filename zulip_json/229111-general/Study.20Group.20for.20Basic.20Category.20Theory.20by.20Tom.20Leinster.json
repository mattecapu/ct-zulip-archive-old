The goal would not be to go over the theory, but to solve the exercises in the book and come up with a solution's manual by the end.<br>\nI've already got some of the gist of CT by reading \"Category Theory for the Sciences\" and now I'm trying to tackle more mathy exercises.<br>\nIf there are people interested, I'll create a topic in the \"learning: reading groups\" stream.</p>",

At the moment, I’m waiting to hear back from a few PhD programs in math I’m waitlisted at, hoping to get some good news soon.</p>\n<p>I’ve been interested in category theory for a little while now, and have been actively digging into it to try to learn more for the past year. I found myself in a weird spot as a math &amp; ES major interested specifically in abstract algebra/topology— I had no idea how I was going to bridge the gap in my interests and apply abstract math to environmental issues. I ended up stumbling into categorical systems theory about a year ago, though, and that changed a whole lot!</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to absorb as much category theory as I can outside my coursework. My interests have shifted a little bit away from applied category theory toward higher categories/categorical logic as of recently, but I still love thinking about compositional systems &amp; games!</p>\n<p>At the moment, I’m working on-and-off on a hobby project to “internalize Minesweeper and related puzzles” in the language of category theory, and use fixed points/coalgebras of certain endofunctors to study the various levels of “solvability” that a Minesweeper board (or other puzzle, like a Sudoku board or a jigsaw puzzle) can have. I’m pretty close to something really neat, I think, but I also need time to flesh out how exactly I want to organize all the work I’ve done and communicate it to others.</p>\n<p>The past couple days, I’ve also been messing around with the idea of using nonstandard-shaped globe categories to define nonstandard higher categories. More specifically, instead of just using finite ordinals/omega to shape a globe category, maybe we could also use larger ordinals or non-totally-ordered well-partial-orders. I would like to figure out exactly which well-partial-orders P admit reasonably-shaped globe categories (if it isn’t just all of them), then take models of those globe categories in Set to make P-graphs. Then, I’d like to construct a monad on the category of those P-graphs that gives the free weak P-category’s underlying P-graph on any given P-graph, and finally look at its algebras. Long term goal is to get to the functoriality of this construction over the category of well-partial-orders and monotone maps between them, and take some sort of Grothendieck construction to be able to talk about functors between differently-shaped P-categories.</p>\n<p>That was a lot— got carried away! Wrapping up, I’m happy to be here and I’m looking forward to sharing thoughts &amp; learning more from everyone. Take care!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hello! I've been lurking for a while, but figured I'd officially join. I am a PhD student in Operations Research, which is an almost entirely applied field. My interest in category theory began informally years ago as a philosophical topic related to complex systems, but only became an earnest effort at formal understanding about a year ago. I exist in a category theory vacuum here, so it's largely a solo effort, and often feels overwhelming. I'd say my level of understanding is medium: I know the basics and have delved into the monoidal category/string diagram world pretty heavily. My formal math background includes exposure to real and complex analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, graph theory. </p>\n<p>I'm specifically interested in applications of category theory to general optimization duality theory (I've at least reviewed the works of Willerton and Fujii), applications to dealing with large optimization problems, and perhaps as a way of augmenting known relations between group theory and integer programming. In short, I'm really trying to think of ways to truly apply CT in my domain, sort out my half-baked ideas, and press forward.</p>\n<p>Any advice or further leads are greatly appreciated!</p>",

The short answer is that geometricaly the descent monad (obtained form the pulllback-existencial  adjunction)  is always a Hopf monad with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure. <br>\nIn a sense, Hopf monads are the groupoids on monoidal (not even braided) categories, and augmented Hopf monads the groups.</p>\n<p>On written there's a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04132\">pre-print which still needs some love</a> and my <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1992/62961\">thesis</a>.

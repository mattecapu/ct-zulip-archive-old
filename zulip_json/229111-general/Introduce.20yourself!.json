I got excited seeing TDB's post on the Entropy chain rule and topology * algebra, and possible connections with Jules Hedges' and Matteo Capucci's work. And now I'm very interested in what the status is on CT inspired AI/ML innovation! I don't understand the deep maths though, my background is in neuro and psychology <span aria-label=\"see no evil\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f648\" role=\"img\" title=\"see no evil\">:see_no_evil:</span> But conceptually, I find it all very fascinating.

I got excited seeing TDB's post on the Entropy chain rule and topology * algebra, and possible connections with Jules Hedges' and Matteo Capucci's work. And now I'm very interested in what the status is on CT inspired AI/ML innovation! I don't understand the deep maths though, my background is in neuro and psychology <span aria-label=\"see no evil\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f648\" role=\"img\" title=\"see no evil\">:see_no_evil:</span> But conceptually, I find it all very fascinating.

My main research focus is on systems science and how it relates to systems engineering and the purposeful human activity systems that make it work. I am in no way well versed in CT, but I believe that since CT and systems science are both transdisciplinary in nature, there is a path to integrate both to formalize systems science and to enhance the perspectives CT possesses (I admit this possibility may already exist within CT, but with your help and guidance we can make the relations explicit).</p>",

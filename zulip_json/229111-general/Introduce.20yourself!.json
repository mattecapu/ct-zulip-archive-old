At the moment, I’m waiting to hear back from a few PhD programs in math I’m waitlisted at, hoping to get some good news soon.</p>\n<p>I’ve been interested in category theory for a little while now, and have been actively digging into it to try to learn more for the past year. I found myself in a weird spot as a math &amp; ES major interested specifically in abstract algebra/topology— I had no idea how I was going to bridge the gap in my interests and apply abstract math to environmental issues. I ended up stumbling into categorical systems theory about a year ago, though, and that changed a whole lot!</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to absorb as much category theory as I can outside my coursework. My interests have shifted a little bit away from applied category theory toward higher categories/categorical logic as of recently, but I still love thinking about compositional systems &amp; games!</p>\n<p>At the moment, I’m working on-and-off on a hobby project to “internalize Minesweeper and related puzzles” in the language of category theory, and use fixed points/coalgebras of certain endofunctors to study the various levels of “solvability” that a Minesweeper board (or other puzzle, like a Sudoku board or a jigsaw puzzle) can have. I’m pretty close to something really neat, I think, but I also need time to flesh out how exactly I want to organize all the work I’ve done and communicate it to others.</p>\n<p>The past couple days, I’ve also been messing around with the idea of using nonstandard-shaped globe categories to define nonstandard higher categories. More specifically, instead of just using finite ordinals/omega to shape a globe category, maybe we could also use larger ordinals or non-totally-ordered well-partial-orders. I would like to figure out exactly which well-partial-orders P admit reasonably-shaped globe categories (if it isn’t just all of them), then take models of those globe categories in Set to make P-graphs. Then, I’d like to construct a monad on the category of those P-graphs that gives the free weak P-category’s underlying P-graph on any given P-graph, and finally look at its algebras. Long term goal is to get to the functoriality of this construction over the category of well-partial-orders and monotone maps between them, and take some sort of Grothendieck construction to be able to talk about functors between differently-shaped P-categories.</p>\n<p>That was a lot— got carried away! Wrapping up, I’m happy to be here and I’m looking forward to sharing thoughts &amp; learning more from everyone. Take care!</p>",

(The forum page with the shutdown announcement is now down, too.) Authors have been locked out of all their pages since (in particular I continue being locked out of my home page, please check by email whether information given there is still accurate, in case it matters).<br>\nThe currently remaining rudimentary page display is hence outdated, besides having been partially broken in the shutdown process; and readers should please beware that the nnLab pages they currently get to see have not been, are not being and cannot be maintained until further notice. (Some pages are not even displaying their latest content as of the shutdown moment anymore.)<br>\nRequests to at least post an alert to this effect on displayed pages have been turned down without reason; and a succession of announcements of system recovery have all passed without effect, instead further functionality has been switched off since. In short, the nnLab installation has de facto died on 29 Dec. 2021, and it is unclear if or when it will be revived in the future, and in which state of coherence or trustworthiness. Myself, I have unfortunately no control or command over the installation, having trusted in volunteer help on this crucial point.<br>\nA hard restart of the entire nnLab project seems to be necessary, and maybe there is some value to this, dire as it feels at this point. If anyone reading this sees themselves willing and capable to set up, host and administrate a research wiki vaguely like the nnLab was, possibly better, then please contact me.\"</p>",

You finance an institute or a startup to get a slice of the possible earnings. From this point of view financing the nlab is a bit of a dead end: It is not intrinsically novel per s√©, it's just a repository. Industry investors have little incentives to invest in something like this instead of moving their money towards something that deliver novel, exploitable research. The only incentive I can think of is philanthropy, which is a very rare thing to find lol</p>",

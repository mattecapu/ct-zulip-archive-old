Here's the email:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Editors -</p>\n<p>The current Executive Board of Compositionality - Brendan Fong, Nina Otter and Josh Tan - want to step down.</p>\n<p>They've done great work in setting up this journal, and I'll review the history below.  Now the Steering Board - Bob Coecke, Valeria de Paiva, Kathryn Hess, Steve Lack, and me - need to appoint new Executive Editors and break the logjam that is holding up the publication of papers. </p>\n<p>Jeremy Gibbons has kindly offered to help typeset papers, at least on a temporary basis, and he's working with Nina to start doing that.  He also has an assistant, Karen Barnes, who has agreed to check Scholastica each week to make sure that nothing has gotten stuck, and to prompt the editorial team if anything has.</p>\n<p>We are looking for 2 people to be Executive Editors.   Previously typesetting was considered an Executive Board role, but we'd like to make that role separate.  Typesetting is what requires most of the work now that the journal is set up - but the Executive Editors still have many other jobs, some listed in the attached PDF. </p>\n<p>Most of all, the Executive Editors need to keep making the journal better and tackle any problems as they arise.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to be an Executive Editor, please fill out this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIEiJHdM1vRKlXZugVP8LKYLaTcbpoLwgcV6Sa1FCiXiMhgg/viewform\">short form</a>.   You can also contact the Steering Board via me, but we'd like to have all candidates on a list.   The most important question on the form: why do you want the job?</p>\n<p>Finally, here is a bit of the history of how we got here.  Paraphrasing Bob Coecke:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brendan and Josh were both in my group in Oxford, and eager to create an ACT community.  I suggested applying for a Lorentz workshop, which then became the first ACT conference, and after that the QPL model was adopted as this has been a successful one.  Josh and I organised the 2nd ACT in Oxford, and Brendan co-organised the third ACT at MIT.  A bit before the 1st ACT, Ilyas Khan asked me if there was an interest in a new journal in category theory, which he was willing to fund.  Before he had funded Quantum, which has been a success story, so we adopted that model, and Brendan, Josh with later also Nina involved volunteered to set it up.  Meanwhile, Brendan is CEO of Topos (again funded by Ilyas Khan), which is taking up most of his time now while Nina is busy with her postdoc and Josh is now finishing his PhD.  I agree that we probably should go for people that have a more stable position.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJohn Baez, Bob Coecke, Valeria de Paiva, Kathryn Hess and Steve Lack </p>\n</blockquote>",

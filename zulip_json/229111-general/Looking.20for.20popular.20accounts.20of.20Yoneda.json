I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>\n<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>",

Earlier today I remembered having read this article (and finding it great), but when I went to look it up I was sort of disappointed that it was more mathematically oriented than I remembered.

I am writing something along the lines of what I wanted (in Spanish) and I think it might be a good idea to translate/paraphrase Tai-Danae there</p>",

For instance, you probably would say that humans could not be fully characterized by their observable properties – no matter how detailed, comprehensive, or hypothetical your collection of properties/relationships for a human is. Humans _probably_ have some hidden state that’s never going to be externally visible (or is random, etc.).</p>\n<p>But this is just a small caveat, since the Yoneda perspective can be very useful when talking about observable parts of the real world and you just have to restrict your attention to that to be strictly in the spirit of the maths. (And perhaps this is just saying that isomorphism and equality of objects are different relations.) I just like to bring it up when talking about the philosophy of math.</p>",

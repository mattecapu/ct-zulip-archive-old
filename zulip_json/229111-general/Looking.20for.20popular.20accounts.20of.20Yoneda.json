I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>\n<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>",

We're not just talking about \"externally visible\" states/properties: it also includes any \"internal\" states <em>which are included in the category</em>. The \"everything\" in question is \"everything that has been abstracted into the categorical model\", and Yoneda really does talk about that everything. The question of whether we can successfully model an informal 'everything' in a sufficiently rich categorical model is independent of the Yoneda perspective, but I suppose \"be aware of which details are captured in your model/the assumptions your model depends on\" is always a healthy thing to keep in mind.</p>",

If all of your properties are external (e.g. behavioral facts about particular beings in some system), implying that you don't have haecceities, then you don't have a setting to talk about internal properties of them, like identity of beings outside of their behavior. This is not surprising if you make this precise in a formal framework, but I think it's worth pointing out to non-mathematicians. Since I think if you phrase things like the Yoneda principle or identity of indiscernibles non-mathematically, the first intuition is skepticism, “why does a bunch of relationships/properties determine all you need to know about a thing?” (if your intuition for “thing” is not “mathematical object”). And then I get curious about what that says about the world mathematics versus the real world. Anyways, IANAPhilosopher.</p>",

(By \"tonk-like,\" I just meant putative connectives like this.) The lesson we draw is: it's not just the existence of any old inference rules that gives meaningful logical connectives, they have to be the right sort of inference rules. They have to be appropriately <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_harmony\">\"harmonious\"</a> with the rest of the inference rules (perhaps part of some 'interlocking adjoints' as Lawvere might put it).</p>",

It turned out that what I was lacking was a way to draw the Lemma - and the Embedding - in a certain shape that made both the main bijections and the gory details all visible at the same time. That shape is explained in the sections 7.3, 8.4 and 8.5 of this paper,</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anggtwu.net/math-b.html#2022-md\">http://anggtwu.net/math-b.html#2022-md</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://anggtwu.net/LATEX/2022on-the-missing.pdf\">http://anggtwu.net/LATEX/2022on-the-missing.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Here's an attempt to put Emily Riehl's example from the ACT2020 in my shape:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anggtwu.net/LATEX/2020riehl.pdf\">http://anggtwu.net/LATEX/2020riehl.pdf</a></p>",

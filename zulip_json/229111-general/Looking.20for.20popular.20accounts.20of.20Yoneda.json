I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>\n<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>",

Earlier today I remembered having read this article (and finding it great), but when I went to look it up I was sort of disappointed that it was more mathematically oriented than I remembered. But now I see that I discarded it too quickly:  that passage you quoted is really good! I am writing something along the lines of what I wanted (in Spanish) and I think it might be a good idea to translate/paraphrase Tai-Danae there</p>",

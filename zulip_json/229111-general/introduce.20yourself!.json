I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>\n<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>",

As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276438\">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>",

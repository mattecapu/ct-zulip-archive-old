Just came to the understanding that, as George Spencer-Brown wrote, if something is obvious from experience, but very hard to prove, then it is probably very close to an axiom of the real world.  Turns out the Jordan Curve Theorem is hard to prove because it is a statement of the definition of a distinction in the Laws of Form.

I finished my PhD in the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh a couple of years ago and I am currently the president of the <a href=\"https://semf.org.es/\">Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research</a> while I continue with my mathematical research and look for postdoc positions. I am currently based between Edinburgh (UK) and Alicante (Spain).</p>\n<p>I first came across category theory due to my work in differential geometry and the mathematical foundations of physics. I was introduced to the subject by Tom Leinster and his students here in Edinburgh. I have recently refocused my interest in category theory due to my current research on higher order systems and, in particular, higher arity structures in mathematics, physics and computer science.</p>\n<p>The main goals of the higher arity research project (which I lead) are outlined in our website that went online recently:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arity.science/\">https://arity.science/</a></p>\n<p>Athough the project as a whole is highly interdisciplinary in scope (we have collaborators ranging from biology to art history), what pertains to category theory, and the reason I am excited to join this online community, is that we are looking for higher arity generalizations of the basic notion of category. This means, in particular, increasing the number of objects related by morphisms in a way that is generally non-sequential and doesn't necessarily conform to an input-output framework. Notions  such as operads and poly/multicategories (and their higher generalizations) are steps in the right direction for the sort of generalizations that we are searching for, but they are still firmly anchored in sequentiality and input-output, i.e. they are all largely formulable in terms of directed graphs, put simply \"they are mostly about arrows\". The idea is to take (directed or otherwise) hypergraphs as a starting point for higher arity analogues of category-like objects.</p>\n<p>There is some work on this topic of higher arity categories from <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01229967.pdf\">Topentcharov</a> in the 1980s but it doesn't seem that much more has been done in that direction. Any pointers to relevant literature are greatly appreciated. We have rediscovered an example of a known structure called a heapoid (a partial ternary operation satisfying a slight modification of associativity) where our approach seems to clarify things greatly and it paves the way to finding meaningful n-ary generalizations of associativity. We describe this in our recent paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05456\">Heaps of Fish: arrays, generalized associativity and heapoids</a></p>\n<p>Any comments or criticisms are most welcome!</p>",

The problem that I see with polycategories is that they are not very \"primitive\" as n-ary structures in the sense that composition is still a binary operation on morphisms. An easy example of a ternary (pre?)category is the class of sets and ternay relations. If we understand composition as a generalization from binary relations, i.e. an operation that takes several relations of a fixed arity and gives another relation of the same arity (the usual case is a pair of binary relations compose to give another binary relation, which in our eyes is the prime example that motivates the usual definition of composition of morphisms in categories), then there are many posibilities. In section 4.3 of our previous paper we identify at least 10 different well-defined composition operations taking trios of ternary relations on sets: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738</a>. This means that if there exists a satisfactory definition of \"ternary category\" understood as a collection of objects and ternary morphisms that compose in a particular way, it is far from being unique.</p>",

I'm currently just exploring my interests, but I quite enjoyed reading condensed math and now analytic geometry, I like categorifications so I am very excited that Professor Rouquier is teaching a course on higher representation theory this Fall, especially since I took a course on Khovanov homology last Spring which was quite fun.  I am currently also working on learning infinity category theory, through <a href=\"https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf\">Riehl's text</a>, which I really really really enjoy reading (it's an amazing book so far and I will talk about it constantly with whoever will listen).<br>\nSome other things about me, pronouns he/him/his, I have ADHD, and enjoy sailing.

My name is Jason Parker, and I'm currently starting my third (and final) year as a postdoctoral researcher at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, working with Rory Lucyshyn-Wright. I'm especially interested in enriched algebraic theories and monads and their various applications to mathematics and computer science, and I've recently developed an interest in applied category theory as well (especially applications of category theory to databases). My website is <a href=\"https://www.jasonparkermath.com/\">https://www.jasonparkermath.com/</a>. Before starting this postdoc, I did my PhD at the University of Ottawa on <em>isotropy</em>, a topic that was co-invented by one of my advisors, Pieter Hofstra, who died unexpectedly this past spring. Philip Scott was my PhD advisor as well.  I will write a more detailed post in the \"our work\" stream sometime this week!</p>",

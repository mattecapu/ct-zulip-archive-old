Then you look at their follows and followers list, and search for people you already know, and follow those. So you build your social network. Of course here you just follow John Baez, and he knows everyone already important in Category Theory (I guess at least) <a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez\">https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez</a> . If you want to find political science scholars, I just found this  <a href=\"https://scholar.social/@SamCrawley/109366587884501943\">https://scholar.social/@SamCrawley/109366587884501943</a> where he links to a huge list of scholars in that field. Sound interesting and dangerous to click on those.</p>\n<p>Being on Mathstodon there is already more  Math discussion than what I could follow in a lifetime.  But I have also found a lot of people on other servers that I follow. The nice thing is I can look at the discussion on mathstodon and that in my personal list and compare the quality.  </p>\n<p>If you follow me you'll find my list is related to programming decentralised social networks, so I follow category theory, scala especially cats libs, open source in general, w3c and ietf standards, security, knowledge engineers, philosophers... It is very likely much too eclectic to build a big following.</p>",

I was looking around to see how modal logic fit into category theory to see if it could help me understand security.  The first really intersting thing I found that amazed me was when I read this article \"Modal Logics are Coalgebraic\" on which I think you are a co-author <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276830\">@Alexander Kurz</span> :-)  So I asked Corina Cirstea to be my supervisor as I was at Southampton.

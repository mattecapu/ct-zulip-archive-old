But it seems I am not very far from understanding the real elegance of this algebraic structure. I realized this after reading papers from Swedler, Haige and Novikov etc. It has also some connections with Galois cohomology. I am not a mathematician but I like to exercise my mind in abstract math thing. Can anyone help me in understanding what makes a monoid a Brauer monoid? If possible, assume I am not an expert or a good student.</p>",

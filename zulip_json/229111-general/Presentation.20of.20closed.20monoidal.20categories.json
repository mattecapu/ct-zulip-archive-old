However, I believe it should be doable to describe this data equivalently by saying that there are eval_{A,B} morphisms for each objects A,B, and Lambda(f) morphisms for each morphism f, satisfying certain equations. I've started working this out myself (in fact, I've used something along these lines fairly recently, in a FSCD2022 paper on rewriting in SCMCs, but I'd like to understand it more systematically). However, I have the impression it should be written somewhere already. Any hint?</p>",

But I was wondering whether there was an existing reference for this style of presentation, perhaps also operating some simplifcation with respect to a plain translation of the unit/counit conditions.</p>\n<p>The question is related to using string diagrams to reason about free SCMCs. Note for the case of SMCs we can confine ourselves to generating objects as wire labels, but this does not seem possible for SCMCs, because arbitrary objects are not just lists of generators but more complex entities (they mix $\\otimes$ with $\\multimap$).</p>",

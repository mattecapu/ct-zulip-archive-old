For many, it's the pleasure of hunting down items because they are rare and for no other reason. Or because they are curiosities or just plain weird. Or because they belong in any well-rounded collection. Or because they have a particular special meaning or value for the individual. </p>\n<p>Remember: \"no question is dumb\".</p>",

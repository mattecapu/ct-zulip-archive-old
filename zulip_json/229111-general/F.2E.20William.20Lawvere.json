For many, it's the pleasure of hunting down items because they are rare and for no other reason. Or because they are curiosities or just plain weird.

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"419987\">@Josh Lalonde</span> <br>\nSo, I decided I needed a break and found the source I was thinking of. Let me start by saying I had my dates a little mixed up in my head. This was after Lawvere's time at Dalhousie. Also, I for some reason thought his Functorial Semantics was later work, when it was actually part of his dissertation. I think it was published later. In any case, this account is immaterial to that work, though both people were alike in spirit with respect to work on categories and syntax/semantics. </p>\n<p>The other person was a biologist I know some here are familiar with given the relationship he had with category theory: Robert Rosen. If you haven't heard of him, I recommend at least doing a quick search.  As far as I am able to discern from literature, he was the first to publish works on applications of category theory outside of mathematics itself. His first such seems to have been in 1958, so pretty early. He also studied the topic under both MacLane and Eilenberg, though transferred out of math to earn his doctorate in biology instead. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, he would develop a model of life (to be distinguished in kind from non-life) using some basic category theory, in addition to lots of writing on abstract \"modeling relations\" (formal syntax-semantics maps), measurement, and feedforward systems which he called \"anticipatory\". There have been mixed reviews on his use of math, since he did not always write it in a rigorous manner, especially when using it to develop his more philosophical ideas. The really interesting part to me IS the philosophy of science work he did, though. In many ways, he (in spirit) anticipated some of the work I see happening recently in this community, especially as relates to questions of compositionality and emergent/generative features, though he used different terms. It's exciting to see math really making formal headway into some of these old questions.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this does relate back to Lawvere! It is possible they knew of each other due to both having been at Columbia with Eilenberg (at different times, though. Rosen left in 1957 and Lawvere arrived in 1960). Rosen would start at SUNY-Buffalo and move to Dalhousie in 1975. Lawvere, of course, was at Dalhousie first and in 1974 moved to SUNY-Buffalo.  But they did in fact know each other when Rosen by his account went to bat for the \"eminent category theorist\" whom he helped get hired at SUNY, just before he left. He doesn't name Lawvere, but I can't imagine any other conclusion.</p>\n<p>So, I don't know if that is helpful to you. I just happen to have been interested in Rosen's work, and recalled that passage. I guess I recalled it being more relevant than it turned out to be once I found the source again. The source, by the way, is \"Old Trends and New Trends in General System Research,\" a memorial lecture he gave for von Bertalanffy. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03081077908960904\">https://doi.org/10.1080/03081077908960904</a></p>\n<p>Here is the excerpt, which follows a brief historical account of the development of category theory. One of his points in the talk was that category theory is a natural language for formally describing Bertalanffy's general system theory (for instance like Mesarovic has tried to do): </p>\n<p>\"It is interesting to note that Category Theory has elicited exactly the same reaction within the community of pure mathematicians that system-theoretic approaches have generated in the community of experimental or empirical scientists. Initially, category theory was dismissed out of hand by many mathematicians as at best a cumbersome language for stating well-known facts about algebraic topology. Later, when it became clear that category theory could answer important open questions in a variety of areas, it was conceded to be of some limited usefulness for specific applications, but still of no significance as an independent branch of mathematics. This attitude is still prevalent; indeed, just a few years ago, I served on the Executive Committee of the Department of Mathematics at SUNY Buffalo, when that department was in the process of hiring an eminent category theorist. A substantial group of senior faculty tried to block this appointment on the grounds that category theory was not real mathematics; they were dissuaded only with difficulty from writing to other departments to collect opinions on whether category theory was mathematics or not.\"</p>\n<p>At the very least, it is interesting to piece together these random connections from the past! Also, there is much to be gleaned by digging through the old texts, finding forgotten threads of research.</p>",

We can view any commutative ring as special abelian group in the topos of actions of its multiplicative monoid, and the category of modules of a ring is a sub-abelian category of the category of abelian groups over this topos. I'm hoping that these observations might be exploited to get a new perspective on homological algebra. If anyone is interested in this, I would be very happy to collaborate on it.</p>",

Next year, however, we'll be starting a spiritual successor, the \"Topos Colloquium” (<a href=\"https://topos.site/seminars\">https://topos.site/seminars</a>), hosted by the Topos Institute (<a href=\"https://topos.institute\">https://topos.institute</a>). This will be at a new Zoom link and a new mailing list. If you wish to be subscribed to the mailing list, then how you do so depends on whether or not you have a Google account:</p>\n<p>— If you do have a Google account (not necessarily linked to a @gmail address), then just send a blank email to seminars+subscribe@topos.institute</p>\n<p>— If you do not have a Google account, then please send an email with the subject line “subscribe” to <a href=\"mailto:tim@topos.institute\">tim@topos.institute</a></p>\n<p>At some point in January we will send out an email to the mailing list with details about the first talk, which is tentatively scheduled for the 4th of February, 2021.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, then please direct them to <a href=\"mailto:tim@topos.institute\">tim@topos.institute</a> as well!</p>",

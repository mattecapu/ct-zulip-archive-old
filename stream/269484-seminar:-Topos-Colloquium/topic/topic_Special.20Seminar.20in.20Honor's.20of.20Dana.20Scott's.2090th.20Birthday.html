<p>On Tuesday, October 11th, Topos will be celebrating Dana Scott's 90th birthday with a special seminar by Gordon Plotkin, titled "Does recursion help?". The seminar will be held both online and in person at the Topos Institute's Berkeley office, with Gordon and Dana both present in person. Dana will say some opening words before Gordon's talk.</p>
<p>An abstract for Gordon's talk, and links to join via Zoom or YouTube<br>
livestream, are below. If you would like to attend in person, please email<br>

Title: Does recursion help?<br>

(He used Church numerals to represent natural numbers.) The lambda-definable functions were shown to be the same as the GÃ¶del-Herbrand general recursive functions and the same as the functions computable by Turing machines. The fixed-point combinator Y is crucial for the proofs, as it enables functions to be defined recursively.</p>
<p>If we switch to the typed lambda-calculus the situation changes drastically.<br>
Helmut Schwichtenberg and Richard Statman showed that only the extended<br>
polynomials can then be defined (they used a typed version of the Church<br>
numerals).</p>
<p>It is natural, therefore, to ask what happens if one adds typed fixed-point<br>
combinators to the typed lambda calculus. We present an answer to this<br>
question. Our answer makes essential use of Dana Scott's domain theory to<br>
model the fixed-point combinators.</p>

<p>This Wednesday (the <strong>18th of May</strong>) at <strong>16:00 UTC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Juan F. Meleiro</strong> (Universidade de São Paulo) — <em>Towards Modular Mathematics</em></p>
<p>Synthetic Reasoning is a style of mathematics based on axiomatic theories that aim to capture the fundamental and essential structures in a particular subject. Such theories are often type theories with intended interpretations inside structured categories such as toposes.</p>
<p>But theorycrafting is currently an artisanal job, that requires analysis and synthesis from scratch for every theory that will be created. A formal (and categorical) toolkit for manipulating these theories could aid the synthetic mathematician in their endeavors, just as a toolbox can help any artisan in their craft.</p>
<p>Modular mathematics is mathematics based on these formal theories that capture a way of Synthetic Reasoning in particular fields, and can then be combined and compared. In this talk, I will present work in progress towards a framework for such modular mathematics. Universal Logic will be our guide for the capabilities that such a framework should provide, including translation between, and combinations of theories. I will present a formal theory called MMT (introduced by Florian Rabe) that follows such a guide. I will then present three formal approaches to the definition of the fundamental group, each following a distinct style: a purely categorical, a syntactical-categorical, and a purely syntactical one; all in order to explore some possible ways to do Modular Mathematics.</p>

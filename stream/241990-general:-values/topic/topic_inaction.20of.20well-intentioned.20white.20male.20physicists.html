<p>Having found this part in the text, I see that they ask what the interviewee would do in various roles relative to Zina. If I were another student in the class I would have the same reaction, although I can't claim that I would have had the confidence to act on it as a first year undergrad. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't read the article.   If I saw this as a student, my immediate reaction would be to sit sort of near Zina.  Did they mention this option?</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting this is a complete solution to the problem, just a thing I'd do.</p>

<p>Okay, they address that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the respondent said they’d sit next to the student, tell them that didn’t happen for this student, despite the fact that many people give this response. Probe (using their language as much as possible) for why this might be.</p>

<p>It's easy to imagine why this might be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So put the responsibility on the student as to whether you, the person in a position of power (say) take any action to address this behaviour? Isn't the student in that scenario under pressure to decline your efforts for the exact reasons that you're pointing out? At least if you take the initiative the other students have less ammunition for "blaming" the victim. But with that said what consequences are you actually imagining here that will be worse than the student's existing isolation from having to sit on their own during class?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think whether you are putting the responsibility on the student depends very much on how you approach them and which language you use. I think you should make it clear that you are absolutely happy to take action and want to, but that you want her blessing first</p>

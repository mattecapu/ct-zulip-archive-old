<p>Three goals for the ACT community (co-written by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span> and myself):</p>
<ol>
<li>Grow and educate the community efficiently</li>
<li>Connect with other domains and gain funding</li>
<li>Determine and coordinate around shared goals</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are all of these good goals for the ACT community?</li>
<li>Are there any good goals for the ACT community that are not covered by this list?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 3-5 presuppose that the list of goals has been amended so that the answers to questions 1 and 2 are "Yes" and "No" respectively, but they can still be considered before this is done.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In what ways are we already pursuing these goals?</li>
<li>How can we do these ways better?</li>
<li>What additional ways can we pursue these goals that we are not doing right now?</li>
</ol>

<p>Goals 1-3 are very unobjectionable; they seem chosen to be uncontroversial, and my answer to question 1 is yes.  </p>
<p>But my personal answer to 2 is probably much more controversial - I would like applied category theory to be a force for positive change (not just change, that's easy).   So, I don't want applied category theory to merely help people do what they're already doing, faster and more efficiently than they already are.    That will just drive our civilization off the cliff faster than we're already going.   It's quite hard to figure out how to do applied math that creates positive change, but some of us are trying to figure it out.   I'm glad that two of my students - Brendan Fong and Nina Otter - have set up institutes that seek to do this (among other things).</p>

<p>As for question 5, I think having lots of serious conversations, in small groups, is a great thing.</p>

<p>Speaking philosophically (ie. vaguely), I would suggest that it is <em>decategorificiation</em> that makes things faster and more efficient, and categorification makes things slower &amp; richer. For example, I view monetary/financial systems as the decategorification of bartering. Not that I'm suggesting we all get back to bartering, but I could imagine everyone having a bartering app that allows for complex multiway exchanges of goods directly, without having to go through any numerical (monetary) device. We already to this with Kidney donation chains. Although it doesn't sound very practical in general.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate a bit more on the above goals so they seem less bland, and also incorporate your added goal:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the biggest bottlenecks for ACT is people who know it!  So we need to (A) bring more people into the field and (B) make knowledge of ACT circulate more efficiently and freely.</li>
<li>Other bottlenecks include funding (hard to find people who want to fund the things that are most important for ACT) and connection with other domains (can't do <em>Applied</em> CT unless CT-ists are working with domain experts, but this is a hard communication problem)</li>
<li>(Some of) the ACT community has a shared sense that ACT can be a force for positive change.  But this can only happen if we can organize as a group and not just be comprised of individual researchers going where the funding is.  So we must determine shared feasible goals for how ACT can be used for good, and then coordinate around them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good idea!  Let's do it!  Can you elaborate on what this would look like?</p>

<p>As you know, Brendan Fong held a kind of round-table discussion of ethics at the Topos Institute, led by my wife Lisa Raphals.    It was good as far as it went, but to really get somewhere they should do it regularly... and perhaps with fewer people, or more groups of fewer people, since it seems hard for concrete plans to crystallize when you have more than, say, 6 people talking at once.</p>

<p>I believe Brendan wants to continue this - and when Lisa and I visit again I bet it will continue, but it really shouldn't be dependent on that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nina Otter is starting up <a href="https://demos-institute.org/about-us">DeMoS</a>, which is directly focused on certain ethical aspects of science - not specifically applied category theory, but we might piggy-back on that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The institute carries out research on topics related to anti-democratic tendencies in our society, as well as on meta-scientific questions on how to make the scientific system more democratic. We believe that research must be done in the presence of those who bear their consequences. Therefore,  we perform our research while at the same time implementing directly practices that promote inclusivity, interdisciplinarity, and in active engagement with society at large.</p>

<p>I think other groups, like research groups at universities, should also have regular conversations about ethical issues in applied category theory.   I don't know if there's anything like this going on at Oxford, or Strathclyde, or Tallinn (three universities that do a lot of applied category theory).    Since <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276037">@Jade Master</span> is at Strathclyde and very interested in this issue, she could start something there.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer a focus on concrete action, which is why I'm spending my time talking to people about "how to build software that uses category theory to help model epidemics" rather than loftier, less actionable issues.   But the advantage of having many small groups talking about things is that different groups can pursue different strategies.</p>

<p>There's <em>probably</em> enough interest at Strathclyde from most of us, although actually knowing what we can say or do is a different matter</p>
<p>One thing I'm thinking about recently is the conflict between our interest in ethics and our interest in clear communication and wide dissemination of our ideas. The second thing certainly doesn't make the first thing a waste of time, but it very much reduces it's possible effectiveness relative to the other possibility, that we became a sort of cabal who solve problems but jealously guard our secret methods</p>

<p>Sorry Jules, I'm having trouble understanding what you are saying.  Probably enough interest in what?  Knowing what you can say or do about what?  And what is the conflict you are seeing between our interest in ethics and our interest in clear communication etc.?  Why would the second thing make us a secret cabal?  Sorry I am very confused</p>

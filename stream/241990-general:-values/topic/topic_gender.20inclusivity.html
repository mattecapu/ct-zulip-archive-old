<p>Please, I would like to draw attention to this thread: <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101">https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101</a></p>
<p>I'm nervous about bringing this up here, and I won't hesitate to mod-nuke my own thread. We know from experience how difficult it is to walk the line between "things whispered behind closed doors" and "internet pile-on". The thread I linked is a HoTT space, but it is directly relevant to us category theorists because many people overlap between our communities</p>
<p>For the record, in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which <em>mostly</em> means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour</p>

<p>I like Emily Riehl's take, and would prefer to avoid the pronoun minefield altogether if I am at all unsure -- and feel that tack ought to be a respected choice. Cf. the Monica Celia kerfuffle over at Stack Exchange. (I respect personal pronoun choices, but find that in extemporaneous speech I sometimes stutter or stumble when applying "their" to a specific singular person. That stuttering is unintentional and in the moment -- if a pronoun collides with my internal sense of language, then the smooth flow of speech may be interrupted. In writing it's different -- I have time to think and regroup.)  </p>
<p>Many of us (especially the older among us) may be on a learning curve. People might unintentionally offend on occasion, so I hope the approach that mods take is one of kindness and understanding. The tone of "I will not accept" is a little worrisome to me: it doesn't sound like one of giving benefit of the doubt. Intentionality matters a great deal here. </p>
<p>Maybe here in <em>this</em> zulip we can go easy on this thumbs down business. Ugh, social media.</p>

<p>I understand that it could feel awkward to use 'they' to refer to someone who you already think of as male or female, but this case was about the sentence '... let us describe how a mathematician reading the above English proof might simultaneously construct, in their head, an element of ...'. In this case we're just talking about an arbitrary mathematician, not someone of known gender.</p>

<p>Oscar, I agree: it's different. I still prefer Emily's workaround. </p>
<p>My stumbling over "they" when speaking in the moment is not a matter of sex or gender, it's the number.</p>

<p>As for the grammar of singular 'they', I have had the rare experience of actually convincing the other side in internet arguments about this topic. The trick is to simply scroll back through the posting history of anyone who objects to using 'they' as a singular, and find an example of them using it themselves. I note that Ellie Hermaszewska already performed this trick for Mike Shulman, and it's also not hard to find an example for Dan Grayson who was the other objector. I suggest anyone else who objects to it first checks their own post history!</p>

<p>And whether people have been using singular "they" for centuries wasn't really my point either. I too can do it and have done it. Whether it invariably feels like the choice I would make if it were up to me -- an entirely different matter. As I say, on some such occasions, I may jump ship altogether and choose a workaround.</p>

<p>The singular 'they' is perfectly comprehensible in modern (and not so modern) English and doesn't require convoluted passive-construction workarounds. We have reclaimed a third-person singular gender neutral pronoun and should employ that rather than the clunky 'his or her'.</p>

<p>Already considering to nuke this thread. To be clear, this is not <em>really</em> about grammar. Making mistakes is totally fine, nobody is going to get in trouble for making mistakes, using "they" to refer to individuals in speech is very jarring at first! I still get it wrong and then correct myself when I catch myself, which is not always. The bad behaviour is not making mistakes, it's <em>doubling down</em> on them</p>

<p>I, too, have difficulty using "they" in the singular, but it's a challenge I choose to embrace! I imagine Shakespeare would have just as much grammatical trouble using "you" in the singular. </p>
<p>Language evolves. We can choose to fight it, or to embrace it. I would prefer to speak a language with no grammatical gender at all. (Or at least a language where grammatical gender doesn't correlate with complex concepts like social gender or biological sex). This particular evolution of pronouns seems like the next best alternative. Grammatical discomfort seems a small price to pay to change our language for the better.</p>

<p>Ah, ok -- I was just reporting what I was told by a Wolof-speaking friend. It seems quite plausible that the language "has gender" by standard linguistic classification but it's just so different from gender in e.g. French that he considers them to be not analogous things.</p>

<p>Sorry for the linguistic sidetracks.</p>
<p>If this thread is meant to be not a discussion but rather a policy statement, then it makes sense to be 200% explicit -- more explicit than a link to a long internet discussion followed by "I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour". The unfortunate fact is that not everybody is on the same page on this issue. So I see 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The messy, painful process of getting people on some common page happens through discussion.</li>
<li>A clear policy is stated, which is intelligible to people who are not on the same page.</li>
<li>Some policy is enforced in an arbitrary manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>My preference is (1). I would object to (3).</p>

<p>It sounds like you're referring to the discussion over at the HoTT zulip, which as I understood it was about the writing of a book involving more than a few authors. That writing is none of the business of this zulip, although people here may hold some strong opinions about what they are discussing. </p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: obviously we're <em>all</em> human beings. As a human being, as a <em>general rule</em> I don't want to be told how I should write. I for one wouldn't be an asshole and "double down" on calling person P "him" if P wants to be called "they". But if we're talking about a person in the abstract, then maybe it would go against my grain, as a human being, to feel compelled to use singular "they" at times when I'd rather not. (Leaving aside how I, Todd Trimble, actually feel about this -- this is only an example. In other words, I'm using "I" in a peculiar way.) How people write is a very personal thing and can be something deeply felt. </p>
<p>Since actually "in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which mostly means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour" does carry more than a whiff of laying down the law -- especially since the notion of <em>power</em> was invoked, I for one would want to get clear on what, then, is considered acceptable to powers that be. The aforementioned episode of Monica Cellio shows what can happen: she was asking whether use of pronouns is <em>compulsory</em> in situations where such use could be avoided (as is virtually always the case, for competent writers). For example, she noted that there may be situations, involving human beings whose first language is not English and who are not immersed in debates involving political correctness, where use of an ostensibly plural form could be genuinely confusing or unclear. And for making inquiries into what the newly emerging Stack Exchange policy was, precisely, she wound up being stripped of her position, and with damage to her reputation. The episode was quite hideous. </p>
<p>Casting the discussion in terms of "grammatical correctness [being] more important than who somebody is as a human being" is putting it pretty tendentiously and in black-and-white terms, in my opinion. There are some nuances here. </p>
<p>By the way, as a moderator myself (over at MathOverflow), I know it's not always an easy job -- and I've had accusations of being "PC police" flung in my direction <em>plenty</em> over the years. It's super-hard threading the needle, sometimes. I hope you don't mind weathering the storm <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I really like the use of "they". I have to stop myself from using "they" to refer to someone who prefers "she" or "he". I find it cleaner and more accurate to conceptualize gender as a one-dimensional interval than a collection of two points labelled "he" and "she" (although this interval model is far from perfect, and one could also argue that "he" and "she" could also be conceptualized differently). However, in this interval model for gender, it is then tricky to concisely refer to a point (or subinterval) on this interval in a concise and convenient way. The potentially lower degree of gender-specificity in "they" strikes me as a reasonable way to indicate the usage of this 1D model for gender. I'd prefer using "their" to "he or she" for a similar reason - in my mental model for gender "he or she" refers to a collection of two points, while "their" refers again to the use of a 1D object for modelling gender.<br>
Hopefully these thoughts are roughly on topic!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>@**Jules Hedges**  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour&quot;.  We&#39;re trying to work out something sensitive in a public discussion, and that involves some back and forth, misunderstandings, flaring tempers, accusations (and worse).  But please don&#39;t unfairly, and blanketly, accuse the people having the discussion in good faith of something unjustified that could stick to them.
</code></pre></div>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276770">@Steve Awodey</span> I think what Jules is referring to as 'gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour' is for example when Mike Shulman explicitly says that people describing themselves as 'transgender, non-binary, etc' sometimes behave in ways that make him 'uncomfortable'. In this case, I think the 'accusation' of being exclusionary is a fairly accurate representation of the situation and Mike Shulman's actions.</p>
<p>I think you make a great point about the necessity to avoid unfair blanket accusations. For example, I would argue that it was an unfair blanket accusation when Mike Shulman claimed that  "there is a movement to replace the fact of biological sex with a socially constructed non-binary notion of gender", a claim that had nothing to do with the PR in question, but served to blanket-paint people Mike disagrees with as ideologically driven. </p>
<p>Since you are actively involved in the discussions both here and on github, is it fair that you're chastising Jules for stating a concrete, verifiable claim, while mentioning nothing to Mike for whom your comment is far more appropriate?</p>

<p>To be frank, as a person belonging to the conservative side of the political spectrum regarding many issues, much of the public discourse around inclusivity policy makes me feel very much excluded almost all the time. I have multiple times being afraid to speak my mind openly especially on public channels like Twitter. Basically, as someone having opinions sometimes orthogonal to what is the more common posture in academia, the risk of people misreading, misunderstanding and deciding to tag me as a bigot or as a fascist make it just not worth it. Obviously I do not consider myself either of the two, and especially I consider fascism utterly repulsive, but experience has taught me that it is easier for people to simplify and distort your opinion when they do not agree with you. Some people actually may even find doing so enjoyable. And yes, this has often very tangible consequences.</p>
<p>...The way I personally cope with this is by saying absolutely nothing, avoiding mentioning politics/value/morals as much as I can especially on the internet, and basically keeping my opinions to myself. But if I have to be frank no, I do not think that many of the inclusive policies I've seen around are as inclusive as people promoting them think they are. And no, I will refrain from being more specific than this, especially in public, exactly due to what I've said above.</p>

<p>You'll notice that one thing notably absent from this discussion is somebody who steps forward and explicitly says "here is my take on the matter, as a person who is frequently misgendered".

<p>Indeed, and I don't deny it. But in my opinion many of the policies discussed to foster inclusivity are skewed towards one end of the political spectrum. I'm not saying this is inherently wrong. I'm saying that a natural consequence of this is that it alienates people, often preventing the possibility of fruitful discussion from the start. For instance, the argument of pronouns as of now is not limited to gender issues. Supporting/not supporting pronoun enforcement has often become an identifier for a given political stance. This is negative, as it creates a distorted logic where people in favor of some ideas may end up openly not supporting them, as they are felt as 'expression of a more general political posture I do not support'. <br>
I think this gives rise also to more radicalization, on both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Indeed, and I don't deny it. But in my opinion many of the policies discussed to foster inclusivity are skewed towards one end of the political spectrum. I'm not saying this is inherently wrong. I'm saying that a natural consequence of this is that it alienates people, often preventing the possibility of fruitful discussion from the start. For instance, the argument of pronouns as of now is not limited to gender issues. Supporting/not supporting pronoun enforcement has often become an identifier for a given political stance. This is negative, as it creates a distorted logic where people in favor of some ideas may end up openly not supporting them, as they are felt as 'expression of a more general political posture I do not support'. <br>
I think this gives rise also to more radicalization, on both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>For sure I won't discuss any of this if not in person, for the issues I mentioned above. I do not think it is possible to have a productive yet critical discussion on the matter, on the internet, in the current political climate. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>FWIW  I support the use of singular "they/their" whenever the need arises: it's a low-cost, easy solution. I would say it's a non-brainer. <br>
 it applies without problems here and everywhere where he or she/ him or her is needed. But I am not one of the 30+ authors of the book, so I can only applaud Martin and Andrej for discussing the proposal, which I endorse.</p>

<p>Even if one is convinced Caramello is getting a lot of mileage out of something small, this is not the way to approach it. We should celebrate fresh approaches, alternative proofs, clearer conceptual pictures.

<p>What happened here was very ugly, but in all fairness Johnstone skipped that slide completely in the live presentation. I am not saying that he is excusable - he is not. But presenting as "proof" something that he himself skipped during the talk is not the best possible ethical choice either.</p>

<p>Problem is I don't know what anybody can do. PJ is a Cambridge professor close to retirement, so he can in practice do virtually anything he wants to. More generally in academic nobody really "allows" anybody to do anything. (There's the nuclear option that conference organisers can "deplatform" a researcher from giving a research talk, which is something I suspect the vast majority would be <em>extremely</em> uncomfortable with.) It seems to me the best (or least-worst) thing we can do is just to talk about it publicly to make it clear what the rest of us think</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> no, what I gave was a slide that was discussed in full (I know the one you mean—and it wasn't left out of the written version of the talk). It was a 10-15 minute takedown of Caramello, I could have picked any one of several slides.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> the public silence about this by the organisers was a choice. I hadn't heard even a rumour about the talk until I saw it myself, months later. Another conference might have released even a non-targeted statement about the expectations about behavioural standards by participants, in particular towards marginalised people. It's not deplatforming, but making it clear to the community such a thing is a highly unprofessional act and not welcome. Maybe senior category theorists had a quiet word in private. But that does not help eg women ECRs or students reconsidering their career choices.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I was on the receiving end of a similar thing on a smaller scale from Bénabou, in public emails IIRC. I had a job outside academia, with no plans to return, so I could shrug it off to some extent. It still wasn't pleasant. People knew he was prone to such things, but I'd hate to think how it would affect someone aiming for a career in ct research.</p>

<p>Oh, I must have confused myself with the other one then, sorry.<br>
In any case, first generation category theorists seem to be rather infamous when it comes to treating people harshly, if not discriminating them outright. I think this is one of the reason why the ACT community was started as an independent endeavor: The tabula rasa approach allowed us to implement better policies, and to my knowledge the situation in ACT is orders of magnitude better when we compare it to the many unhappy circumstances that happened in traditional CT</p>

<p>So no, talking about it is not the only thing we can do. Moreover, deplatforming is not really going to work in my opinion. Also I'm conceptually kind of opposed to it as I fear the consequences it could have on freedom of expression when it is applied blindly. What we can really do - and we are doing that - is starting new communities/research fields as independent, setting a very clear policy from the start. At that point, whoever wants to join said communities will know which behaviors are tolerated and which ones are not. Clearly it could happen that we have incidents or unpleasant situations, and it will happen that we will need to rediscuss our code of conduct from time to time. Yet, these discussions will be framed in a much clearer framework, and imho this helps a lot.</p>

<p>I would not go so far as Tim, because I suspect that the situation with Caramello might be much more complicated than it's being portrayed. In particular, some very serious allegations were made by her against Martin Hyland, who has unquestionably done the community a great deal of good. I don't know what to think, but here I'd withhold judgment. </p>
<p>I agree that the CT20--&gt;21 talk was indecorous to say the least and PTJ shouldn't have aired this stuff, but I'm sure he's felt very maligned by Caramello, in a situation which had been going on for years before then. </p>
<p>Mathematically, even if we assume Caramello was rediscovering stuff known to the cognoscenti, she's doing a great deal of good bringing attention to the conceptual power of topos theory to a wider world.</p>

<p>The real problem with this is that one can be at the same time a great researcher and an awful human being. There are countless examples of this, starting with Newton if not before. Having taken note of this unhappy fact of life, I guess what one can do is setting guidelines so that awful person X has to behave nicely when working in direct contact with our community. I feel that complete deplatforming may end up hurting the community way more than it hurts the person.</p>

<p>To what Fabrizio said (and I mostly agree with the spirit), I would add that "awful person" is such a blanketing term. We can agree that some people sometimes do things we consider awful, but in other instances, they do a great deal of good. </p>
<p>I would also say that people can change and evolve. In the US we have countless stories of people who believe that gay people are wicked, or who "choose" to be gay as a lifestyle choice [against what God intended, etc., etc.] -- until their son announces (with great trepidation) that he is gay, and then some hard internal questioning and searching may take place and the parent eventually turns around. Doesn't always happen, obviously, but it certainly can. I've seen it happen with people close to me. </p>
<p>Deplatforming (which would be sort of like punishing) is not the way to go, in my opinion. Open conversation, including with the person we think is behaving badly, is much much better. </p>
<p>All this being said -- and in case it wasn't clear, based on things I said earlier -- I take strong exception to some things Mike Shulman said in the other forum, and I feel badly about pain that was undoubtedly occasioned by his words. I also know him to be on many occasions a kind and gentle person, on top of being an excellent mathematician.</p>

<p>I don't think that is the right comparison to make. Deplatforming is warranted when it causes less harm to the community than the harm done by "awful person X" to the community (it is in no way meant to hurt that person, although it inevitably does). This assessment is very hard to make and I don't want to comment precisely on the concrete situations discussed above, but in general, I value the quality of the research environment above all of the scientific production in the world. Thus, I am against making a huge effort (as a community, I don't mind if individuals want to make that effort) to keep someone in line no matter their position in the community.</p>

<p>Todd, I mean no disrespect, but I am puzzled by the structure of this sentence. Is your argument that <em>because</em> Martin Hyland has unquestionably done the community a great deal of good, <em>then</em> the very serious accusations by Caramello are not worth listening to? Or that it was wrong for Caramello to make serious accusations against someone who has done the community a great deal of good?</p>
<p>And if the allegations are so serious that we should hold our judgement in whether PTJ is justified in publicly bullying her, then shouldn't we hear them before making up our mind, rather than discuss them with vague allusions?</p>
<p>I am also very uncomfortable to hear that PTJ was criticising Caramello's <em>work</em> as a proxy of airing his personal grievances with her. I hope people can see the problem with this kind of intellectual dishonesty, and how bad it would be if it became standard practice within an academic community?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> I do not mean to single you out in the above, I am sure that you've meant your comment with the best intentions. I just strongly believe that it does not help anyone if serious allegations get relegated to private channels and we never hear of them. This was the case with how academia worked in the past, and I believe that it's important to change that. </p>
<p>If it wasn't for the HoTT github thread, I at least would have never known that Mike Shulman has a trans grad student, and that his beliefs have caused a friction between them. And I think it's important to ask ourselves, as a community, how we will respond if as a result of this friction she will leave the field? I can only speak for myself, but if I was in her situation, that's what I would be seriously thinking of.</p>
<p>Would people here really be okay with sweeping the whole situation under the rug, and only referring to the incident in the vaguest of terms as some "serious allegations against Mike Shulman, who has unquestionably done a great deal for this community and the advancement of categorical logic"?</p>

<p>Zanzi, I'm not making that argument. Here I'm suspending judgment: it's possible that Hyland did the things she said, on general grounds that people do bad things on occasion. At the same time, it's a bit of she said/he said [nothing], and I'm having trouble balancing her allegation against the idea I've formed of the man, whom I know a little, and who has been a champion of young women starting careers in mathematics and has supported them greatly. I suspect we might not be getting the whole story, but I'm trying to keep an open mind. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by private channels. We're talking openly here, aren't we? If you feel I'm speaking obliquely, it's because I'm not sure whether I should mention a student by name who is associated with Mike and who is trans. Maybe it'd be okay, or maybe she wouldn't like to be discussed by strangers. I'm not good with these things.</p>

<p>Yes, thank you, that's what I was asking about! I will have a look, but it looks like a lot of writing to be honest. It'd help to narrow down which specific allegations are the ones that seem the most questionable, but I'll admit that maybe it's best if I focus on one issue at a time. I only brought up Olivia because her and Astra's situation seemed similar on the surface, since both Mike and Martin are well-established community members who have made great contributions to the field.</p>

<p>I assume it's fine to use Astra's name and refer to the public information that she shared, since she did choose to come forward with it. And I do feel that it's important to discuss this, given that we're talking about gender inclusivity and why some women leave the field, and here is an actual woman with a tangible risk of leaving the field.</p>

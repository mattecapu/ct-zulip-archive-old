<p>Please, I would like to draw attention to this thread: <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101">https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101</a></p>
<p>I'm nervous about bringing this up here, and I won't hesitate to mod-nuke my own thread. We know from experience how difficult it is to walk the line between "things whispered behind closed doors" and "internet pile-on". The thread I linked is a HoTT space, but it is directly relevant to us category theorists because many people overlap between our communities</p>
<p>For the record, in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which <em>mostly</em> means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour</p>

<p>I like Emily Riehl's take, and would prefer to avoid the pronoun minefield altogether if I am at all unsure -- and feel that tack ought to be a respected choice. Cf. the Monica Celia kerfuffle over at Stack Exchange. (I respect personal pronoun choices, but find that in extemporaneous speech I sometimes stutter or stumble when applying "their" to a specific singular person. That stuttering is unintentional and in the moment -- if a pronoun collides with my internal sense of language, then the smooth flow of speech may be interrupted. In writing it's different -- I have time to think and regroup.)  </p>
<p>Many of us (especially the older among us) may be on a learning curve. People might unintentionally offend on occasion, so I hope the approach that mods take is one of kindness and understanding. The tone of "I will not accept" is a little worrisome to me: it doesn't sound like one of giving benefit of the doubt. Intentionality matters a great deal here. </p>
<p>Maybe here in <em>this</em> zulip we can go easy on this thumbs down business. Ugh, social media.</p>

<p>I understand that it could feel awkward to use 'they' to refer to someone who you already think of as male or female, but this case was about the sentence '... let us describe how a mathematician reading the above English proof might simultaneously construct, in their head, an element of ...'. In this case we're just talking about an arbitrary mathematician, not someone of known gender.</p>

<p>Oscar, I agree: it's different. I still prefer Emily's workaround. </p>
<p>My stumbling over "they" when speaking in the moment is not a matter of sex or gender, it's the number.</p>

<p>As for the grammar of singular 'they', I have had the rare experience of actually convincing the other side in internet arguments about this topic. The trick is to simply scroll back through the posting history of anyone who objects to using 'they' as a singular, and find an example of them using it themselves. I note that Ellie Hermaszewska already performed this trick for Mike Shulman, and it's also not hard to find an example for Dan Grayson who was the other objector. I suggest anyone else who objects to it first checks their own post history!</p>

<p>And whether people have been using singular "they" for centuries wasn't really my point either. I too can do it and have done it. Whether it invariably feels like the choice I would make if it were up to me -- an entirely different matter. As I say, on some such occasions, I may jump ship altogether and choose a workaround.</p>

<p>The singular 'they' is perfectly comprehensible in modern (and not so modern) English and doesn't require convoluted passive-construction workarounds. We have reclaimed a third-person singular gender neutral pronoun and should employ that rather than the clunky 'his or her'.</p>

<p>Already considering to nuke this thread. To be clear, this is not <em>really</em> about grammar. Making mistakes is totally fine, nobody is going to get in trouble for making mistakes, using "they" to refer to individuals in speech is very jarring at first! I still get it wrong and then correct myself when I catch myself, which is not always. The bad behaviour is not making mistakes, it's <em>doubling down</em> on them</p>

<p>I, too, have difficulty using "they" in the singular, but it's a challenge I choose to embrace! I imagine Shakespeare would have just as much grammatical trouble using "you" in the singular. </p>
<p>Language evolves. We can choose to fight it, or to embrace it. I would prefer to speak a language with no grammatical gender at all. (Or at least a language where grammatical gender doesn't correlate with complex concepts like social gender or biological sex). This particular evolution of pronouns seems like the next best alternative. Grammatical discomfort seems a small price to pay to change our language for the better.</p>

<p>Ah, ok -- I was just reporting what I was told by a Wolof-speaking friend. It seems quite plausible that the language "has gender" by standard linguistic classification but it's just so different from gender in e.g. French that he considers them to be not analogous things.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> in fact believe that grammatical correctness is more important that who somebody is as a person, then I have nothing to say to you.

<p>Sorry for the linguistic sidetracks.</p>
<p>If this thread is meant to be not a discussion but rather a policy statement, then it makes sense to be 200% explicit -- more explicit than a link to a long internet discussion followed by "I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour". The unfortunate fact is that not everybody is on the same page on this issue. So I see 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The messy, painful process of getting people on some common page happens through discussion.</li>
<li>A clear policy is stated, which is intelligible to people who are not on the same page.</li>
<li>Some policy is enforced in an arbitrary manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>My preference is (1). I would object to (3).</p>

<p>It sounds like you're referring to the discussion over at the HoTT zulip, which as I understood it was about the writing of a book involving more than a few authors. That writing is none of the business of this zulip, although people here may hold some strong opinions about what they are discussing. </p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: obviously we're <em>all</em> human beings. As a human being, as a <em>general rule</em> I don't want to be told how I should write. I for one wouldn't be an asshole and "double down" on calling person P "him" if P wants to be called "they". But if we're talking about a person in the abstract, then maybe it would go against my grain, as a human being, to feel compelled to use singular "they" at times when I'd rather not. (Leaving aside how I, Todd Trimble, actually feel about this -- this is only an example. In other words, I'm using "I" in a peculiar way.) How people write is a very personal thing and can be something deeply felt. </p>
<p>Since actually "in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which mostly means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour" does carry more than a whiff of laying down the law -- especially since the notion of <em>power</em> was invoked, I for one would want to get clear on what, then, is considered acceptable to powers that be. The aforementioned episode of Monica Cellio shows what can happen: she was asking whether use of pronouns is <em>compulsory</em> in situations where such use could be avoided (as is virtually always the case, for competent writers). For example, she noted that there may be situations, involving human beings whose first language is not English and who are not immersed in debates involving political correctness, where use of an ostensibly plural form could be genuinely confusing or unclear. And for making inquiries into what the newly emerging Stack Exchange policy was, precisely, she wound up being stripped of her position, and with damage to her reputation. The episode was quite hideous. </p>
<p>Casting the discussion in terms of "grammatical correctness [being] more important than who somebody is as a human being" is putting it pretty tendentiously and in black-and-white terms, in my opinion. There are some nuances here. </p>
<p>By the way, as a moderator myself (over at MathOverflow), I know it's not always an easy job -- and I've had accusations of being "PC police" flung in my direction <em>plenty</em> over the years. It's super-hard threading the needle, sometimes. I hope you don't mind weathering the storm <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I really like the use of "they". I have to stop myself from using "they" to refer to someone who prefers "she" or "he". I find it cleaner and more accurate to conceptualize gender as a one-dimensional interval than a collection of two points labelled "he" and "she" (although this interval model is far from perfect, and one could also argue that "he" and "she" could also be conceptualized differently). However, in this interval model for gender, it is then tricky to concisely refer to a point (or subinterval) on this interval in a concise and convenient way. The potentially lower degree of gender-specificity in "they" strikes me as a reasonable way to indicate the usage of this 1D model for gender. I'd prefer using "their" to "he or she" for a similar reason - in my mental model for gender "he or she" refers to a collection of two points, while "their" refers again to the use of a 1D object for modelling gender.<br>
Hopefully these thoughts are roughly on topic!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>@**Jules Hedges**  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour&quot;.  We&#39;re trying to work out something sensitive in a public discussion, and that involves some back and forth, misunderstandings, flaring tempers, accusations (and worse).  But please don&#39;t unfairly, and blanketly, accuse the people having the discussion in good faith of something unjustified that could stick to them.
</code></pre></div>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276770">@Steve Awodey</span> I think what Jules is referring to as 'gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour' is for example when Mike Shulman explicitly says that people describing themselves as 'transgender, non-binary, etc' sometimes behave in ways that make him 'uncomfortable'. In this case, I think the 'accusation' of being exclusionary is a fairly accurate representation of the situation and Mike Shulman's actions.</p>
<p>I think you make a great point about the necessity to avoid unfair blanket accusations. For example, I would argue that it was an unfair blanket accusation when Mike Shulman claimed that  "there is a movement to replace the fact of biological sex with a socially constructed non-binary notion of gender", a claim that had nothing to do with the PR in question, but served to blanket-paint people Mike disagrees with as ideologically driven. </p>
<p>Since you are actively involved in the discussions both here and on github, is it fair that you're chastising Jules for stating a concrete, verifiable claim, while mentioning nothing to Mike for whom your comment is far more appropriate?</p>

<p>To be frank, as a person belonging to the conservative side of the political spectrum regarding many issues, much of the public discourse around inclusivity policy makes me feel very much excluded almost all the time. I have multiple times being afraid to speak my mind openly especially on public channels like Twitter. Basically, as someone having opinions sometimes orthogonal to what is the more common posture in academia, the risk of people misreading, misunderstanding and deciding to tag me as a bigot or as a fascist make it just not worth it. Obviously I do not consider myself either of the two, and especially I consider fascism utterly repulsive, but experience has taught me that it is easier for people to simplify and distort your opinion when they do not agree with you. Some people actually may even find doing so enjoyable. And yes, this has often very tangible consequences.</p>
<p>...The way I personally cope with this is by saying absolutely nothing, avoiding mentioning politics/value/morals as much as I can especially on the internet, and basically keeping my opinions to myself. But if I have to be frank no, I do not think that many of the inclusive policies I've seen around are as inclusive as people promoting them think they are. And no, I will refrain from being more specific than this, especially in public, exactly due to what I've said above.</p>

<p>What I meant is that what the authors write in their book is their decision and their decision alone to make. Of course we on the outside can seek to influence their decision; after all, the discussion is being held in public. Probably we don't really disagree about this.</p>

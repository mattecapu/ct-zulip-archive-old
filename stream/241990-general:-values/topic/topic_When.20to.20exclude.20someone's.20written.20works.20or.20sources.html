<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> has a list of introductions to category theory in another thread in this Zulip by Peter Smith. I have also personally recommended Peter Smith's guide "Teach Yourself Logic" to people on occasion. There are lots of good resources on his blog.</p>
<p>However, Peter Smith is a bad person and should be persona non grata in the community of logicians and category theorists. He has committed some horrifying crimes, the specifics of which are perhaps better left unsaid. Certainly I would strongly encourage any convention or conference not to invite him. I would like to pose it as an open question for discussion: if the person themselves is absolutely unwelcome in the community because of their behavior, should that extend to their published work, blogs and so on?</p>
<p>Would it be better to compose alternative resources? I don't know, honestly. Is there any real harm in linking somebody to his blog or website? Is it worth warning people "Oh, yes, this is also a really bad guy who should not be welcome here"</p>

<p>I think there are three categories.</p>
<p>If your research builds on the research of another person it is academically dishonest not to cite them.</p>
<p>If on the otherhand someone is a serial plagiarist then it is academically dishonest to cite them.</p>
<p>If you don't want to give someone a promotion because there is some non-academic reason why people don't like them, that is a different issue.</p>

<p>This much is the part that everyone agrees on, which sometimes makes life easier when dealing with very complicated issues</p>
<p>A gnarlier situation is when it goes beyond citing someone, to honouring them with naming scientific concepts. In our field, the big one is Freyd.</p>

<p>We shouldn't name things after people in the first place, no matter how great they are.  I think it is better to have well structured naming conventions.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277391">@Cole Comfort</span> I agree in general, but theorems tend somewhat inevitably to get people's names attached to them, and avoiding those is trickier (although it's possible to be bullheaded about it and just drop a name sometimes)</p>

<p>Sometimes there are other names that are good alternatives.  For a purely pragmatic reason I much prefer to use the term "effectful category" over "Freyd category."  But it is not as entrenched as say, Yoneda's Lemma, which could just as easily be called something like "the embedding theorem" or the "representation theorem"</p>

<p>I am quite opposed to this. If you or someone else has some specific behavior you would like to condemn, go ahead and do it publicly.</p>

<p>I would like to share this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/scientist.pdf">The Responsibility of the Scientist Today</a>, Alexandre Grothendieck, 1970</li>
</ul>
<p>Grothendieck posits that scientists have a responsibility to humanity as a whole,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist, as the principal architect of technological progress, must assume a major part of the responsibility for the unprecedented dangers that modern technology has posed for mankind.  Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious "gray matter", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming "helplessness" or "personal insecurity" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate "passively" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on "pure" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the "military manna" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>

<p>That would be nice, but in this article Grothendieck is also arguing against more passive collaboration with the military than what Bob and David do...e.g. collaborating with people who work with military. I am interested in perspectives from people who do that as well.</p>

<p>Is your point that category theory has benefited a lot from military money in the past, so it can't be that bad of a thing?</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>Clearly these are still very experimental ways of doing things, I admit. But the model is just so much better than the usual university/grant one that I reckon it will be increasingly common in the future</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>Even within the US military it's hard to put blame on particular people, it is a massive bureaucracy and there are some people whose work is a genuine positive in the world.  The thing with massive bureaucracies is everyone shares a small amount of the blame, so it is our personality responsibility to do what can to make things better.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm trying to use category theory (and lots of other math) to help understand some things about chemistry, biology, ecology and economics.  You could say I'm trying to understand open systems, how they process information, how they evolve, how they thrive or fail to thrive... but also that I constantly get side-tracked by the beautiful math that seems to be the prerequisite  for understanding these things.</p>
<p>In the process I became a subcontractor for the DARPA program called CASCADE, for <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-1/">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a>.  I had some misgivings about this... decided to give it a try... came up with some cool stuff, helped fund <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275953">@Blake Pollard</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>, who both went on to get jobs at NIST based in part on this work... and eventually got frustrated and quit, mainly because the program was not set up to give us time to explore the ideas I thought were interesting, but also because the intended military applications became more clear, and I didn't want to pursue those goals.</p>
<p>More recently I've been talking to James Fairbanks and Evan Patterson about biochemistry: using math to infer Petri nets with rates from data.  This is actually a big topic in biochemistry, though of course not many people are trying to use category theory.   James has gotten grant money from the Defense Department for this project, but I'm not letting that deter me, because the benefits of what we're doing outweigh any harm it might do.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm trying to use category theory (and lots of other math) to help understand some things about chemistry, biology, ecology and economics.  You could say I'm trying to understand open systems, how they process information, how they evolve, how they thrive or fail to thrive... but also that I constantly get side-tracked by the beautiful math that seems to be the prerequisite  for understanding these things.</p>
<p>In the process I became a subcontractor for the DARPA program called CASCADE, for <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-1/">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a>.  I had some misgivings about this... decided to give it a try... came up with some cool stuff, helped fund <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275953">Blake Pollard</span> and <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275914">Joe Moeller</span>, who both went on to get jobs at NIST based in part on this work... and eventually got frustrated and quit, mainly because the program was not set up to give us time to explore the ideas I thought were interesting, but also because the intended military applications became more clear, and I didn't want to pursue those goals.</p>
<p>More recently I've been talking to James Fairbanks and Evan Patterson about biochemistry: using math to infer Petri nets with rates from data.  This is actually a big topic in biochemistry, though of course not many people are trying to use category theory.   James has gotten grant money from the Defense Department for this project, but I'm not letting that deter me, because the benefits of what we're doing outweigh any harm it might do.</p>

<p>Not to interrogate you in particular, but why are you so sure the benefits outweigh the harm. Can you know for certain what sort of collaborations your work will lead to in the future?</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not making a comment on whether or not one should take money from the US millitary, but I really dislike the fact that people very often automatically assume that decisions made in America's supposed best interest are in my nation's own best interest.  People would perhaps act less sanctimoniously if non-western militaries were offering money.</p>

<p>So I understand on a intuitive level that accepting military funding is icky, but I'm having a hard time accepting the argument of "you never know what they are going to use the research for". The cases I'm aware of, Bob Coecke working on CQM and natural language stuff, he had complete freedom in choosing his research. So the research would have been the same whether funded by regular grants, or by the military. So if the argument is that the military might use it for bad things, then why isn't this a problem if it is not funded by the military? Or is the argument more that you are normalising the presence of military things in academia?</p>

<p>Let me turn around the question: I haven't really heard any super convincing argument to not accept the funding other than "military bad" and  a vague notion of not wanting to normalise military in research. Now, while I agree with these things and they would be enough reason to stop me doing something less important, like say, skip going to some store, this is about my livelihood. So I would hope there were some more concrete arguments.

<p>My first thought is, the world of 2021 is (as far as I know) a much more <em>complicated</em> place to live than the world of 1970. Back then it was pretty straightforward: the world consisted of 2 superpowers vying for dominance, and there would either be a nuclear apocalypse or there wouldn't, no middle option was likely. Life in 2021 is much more subtle than that. There are still the big-E Evils, like the US military, BAE systems and whatever, the people who go out and shoot civilians. We also have to worry about the compound effect of a bunch of way more subtle evils</p>

<p>I'm not "so sure".     I just follow my instincts.    If I were trying to be certain about things I would never have worked on n-category theory, and I never would have gotten interested in applied category theory; a lot of people thought these ideas were crazy.   I can try to explain my instincts, but being "sure" or "certain" has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>It'd be interesting to see how strong is the correlation between research being funded by the military and technology being developed for the military. Unless they figured out a wonderful pipeline for turning science into technology, it seems unlikely they are extracting more technology than they would if they didn't fund researchers directly (and I think that's why they rain money on everyone: the only thing they can exploit is volume).<br>
This disqualifies the moral responsibility of scientists for military technology, imo, at least for those who work far enough from the actual development (of course von Braun is quite responsible for V2 missiles, but Newton?).<br>
So to me the big problem is to have the military controlling research-space, which is quite awful. Also I guess everybody would be enrolled in the next Manhattan project as soon as something bad happens.</p>

<p>I understand what John says... We don't want to slippery slope our way into not accepting funds from anyone. Fab, I'd say even crypto might be criticized as being highly unethical in some respects: it enables a lot of criminal activity, and BTC is now an additional nation our already overexploited planet has to support.<br>
I guess John is rightly asking how to we discriminate between 'bad' and 'good', because it's easy to find the bad in a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>Personally I'd prefer a military having a smaller budget and more research funded directly, but assuming we can't choose the size of the budget (I'm not a voter in US), it seems obvious to me that it's better spent on no-strings-attached grants on category theory than on whatever their alternative is (but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise). Kinda like I think it's good that CIA spent all that money on modern art back in the day than did more of whatever they were otherwise up to.</p>

<p>And yes, once you start questioning things, it's hard to find any unambiguously clean source of funding. So it becomes a question of where each individual will draw an arbitrary line in the middle of a spectrum of greys</p>

<p>Personally I'd prefer a military having a smaller budget and more research funded directly, but assuming we can't choose the size of the budget (I'm not a voter in US), it seems obvious to me that it's better spent on no-strings-attached grants on category theory than on whatever their alternative is (but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise). Kinda like I think it's good that CIA spent all that money on modern art back in the day than did more of whatever they were otherwise up to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first no is to the idea that that it's harmless to be funded for doing something useless. Apart from anything else, it makes the funder look benevolent, which they may not be.</p>
<p>The second no is to the assertion that the research is useless.</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>That + they seem more benevolent when they do research as well + they might be able to direct research in directions they like. Given all this, I agree that it's preferrable if science was funded directly rather than via the military, but I'm not sure that's the choice we're making. On the margin, the military either gives the money for some particular research or it does something else. In the case of Mac Lane (or other projects mentioned in the comments), it's not obvious to me that this "something else" is a better use of that same money.</p>

<p>"The DoD wants to normalize themselves in your non-mathematical communities."<br>
So, I still don't buy this argument. To me it feels that the only thing we're normalising is the accepting of <em>funding</em> from the military. I mean, some of us here have directly benefited from military funding and yet we are still all in agreement that the military is evil and should be defunded.</p>
<p>As a side-note: if you are funded by military and have to include a "This research was funded by..." blurb in the Acknowledgements of your paper, could you then also add another line saying "I think the military is evil, I'm only accepting this money because I need funding", or would that be dissallowed by your grant?</p>

<p>Okay, I think we might have different ideas about what it entails to accept funding from the military. I'm coming from the viewpoint of Bob, where as far as I understand, he basically got money to do what he wants, without any further interaction with any researchers or employees of the military. If there were such interactions I think there is a much stronger case that this is a bad^{tm} thing to do.</p>

<p>Right, there are different forms funding can take. Jade had a close second-hand view of John and I working on this DARPA project where they had a project, and we joined in on it, via the company Metron. This is very different than just getting handed a bunch of money to do what you like.</p>

<p>That + they seem more benevolent when they do research as well + they might be able to direct research in directions they like. Given all this, I agree that it's preferrable if science was funded directly rather than via the military, but I'm not sure that's the choice we're making. On the margin, the military either gives the money for some particular research or it does something else. In the case of Mac Lane (or other projects mentioned in the comments), it's not obvious to me that this "something else" is a better use of that same money.</p>

<p>Grothendieck had a great response to this;</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>However,  by  accepting  their  funds  through  military  channels,  scientists  help  to augment  the  importance  of  themilitary  in  the  life  of  the  nation –to  the  extent  that  the army finances research, the part of the national revenue devoted to the military will be increased  accordingly.    Thus  even  if  scientists  accept  massive  amounts  from  the military, it will not diminish –even by one –the number of weapons the army has at its disposal, nor the number of victims massacred by this same army when it is engaged in a  war,  as  is  actually  the  case  in  the  USA <br>
[...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support of pure scientific research lends a degree of respectability and even an aura  of  innocence  to  the  army.    How  can  one  hope  that  the  man-in-the-street  or  the politician  will  wake  up  to  these  ignoble  escapades  that  might  prove  fatal  to  all  of  us, when he sees the entire scientific community collaborating with the very apparatus that poses these threats?<br>
[...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certainly  research  is  an  agreeable  activity  for  those  who  engage  in  it, sometimes   even   exalting.      That   doesn't   establish   its   utility,   or   that   its   positive consequences,  outweigh  the  negative  ones.    Too  often  it  has  served  the  vilification  of man,  from  the  beginning  of  the  industrial  revolution  until  today,  when  it  may  well prove  to  be  the  tool  of  its  own  final  destruction.    In  fact  the  men  whose  activities  have been  the  most  dangerous  and  deadly  for  humanity  over  the  past  thirty  years  are  not heads  of  state,  nor  generals,  but  scientists –for  without  them,  the  military  would  have remained  relatively  inoffensive. From  this  global  perspective,  I  am  convinced  that  no scientific  discovery,  however  useful  it  may  appear  to  be,  can  compensate  for  or  justify the collaboration of a scientist with the military.<br>

<p>I have less experience with the type of funding where they don't interfere much, but I have a hard time believing that they would give you millions of dollars if there wasn't something they got out of it.

<p>I'm not being obtuse on purpose - I'm just trying to learn.

<p>Thus even if scientists accept massive amounts from the military, it will not diminish –even by one –the number of weapons the army has at its disposal, nor the number of victims massacred by this same army when it is engaged in a war, as is actually the case in the USA </p>

<p>This one I don't find obvious - I now think it's nontrivial to estimate whether funding taken by scientists decreases the remaining army budget, doesn't change it all or increases it (due to them looking better).</p>

<p>Couldn't you also put this the other way: the military is more likely to want to fund research that will have <em>some</em> impact on society, while most math research does not have any impact. As random research that has an affect on society is more likely to be positive than negative (debatable), it is positive utility to accept military funding as it forces you to think about research that has some impact on society.</p>

<p>I agree that this _can_ happen, but it's not obvious to me that that's always the case. If it were always true, wouldn't army e.g. double its research budget given that it would still have at least as much left for everything else?</p>

<p>Like I can really see it going either way - for some level of funding, giving more to science gives you even more back from the taxpayer, and at some point it'll give less. It's not at all clear to me where we are on that curve.</p>

<p>Oh dear, this conversation on this forum, including the very existence of this forum would not have happened if it wasn't for accepting money that was without constraints, the easiest money whatever, whether it came from military or religious fanatics.  Many people writing here wouldn't have been in academia at all.  Not gonna start naming people but from what I know that's surely 50+ and probably 100+ at least, several in this conversation.  You want them all to vanish like in the Avengers?  Just klick your fingers then, I'll provide you with their names.  The fact that there is now this flourishing ACT community, as well as QPL, quantum foundations etc.  wouldn't have happened without that. If you are not mainstream, you have to seek alternative resources.   The reality is that with the exception of some CS places in Europe, CT was dying 20 years ago, big centres were evaporating.   I was unemployed, since the CT community driven by utopian sofa ideology had not taken care at all of its offspring, being just busy with person cults. The end of the species was looming.  I spend a major chunk of the past 20 years, and continuing to do so now, to generate jobs for enabling people to do interesting things.   We build a group through which some 300 people came trough, now having their own groups elsewhere.  You want them all to vanish?  I can give the names.  Tell them.  "When we take money, we endorse the people from whom we take money", yeah right, and the military is going to get more money because of some category theoretician respecting them, right.  What I have seen instead  is that people who helped us are doing so because they believe in good science and have a hell of a job trying to justify that to their admirals.  I have seen some of those loose their jobs cause they gave money to people like me; I have a lot more respect for them than for sofa ideologists who don't bother to help with the procreation of their community.  (yes, I am an animal)  Cheers!</p>

<p>By the way, you never get handed money to do <em>whatever</em> you like.  You have to write grant applications and at least <em>claim</em> you're going to work on some "hot topic".   People who repeatedly get grants tend to be ones that succeed in doing approximately what they claimed they'd do.  So the whole grantsmanship game - which dominates the sciences these days - really pushes people toward "hot topics".</p>
<p>But you're right about this: what you and I had was not a grant, it was a <em>subcontract</em> - so we were being bossed around more.</p>

<p>von Neumann was a complicated man. If I remember correctly from the biography I read he escaped Hungary when it come under soviet control, and he felt Stalin was the most dangerous man in the world, and really unpredictable. But I don't think he advocated a preemptive strike, just that the united states should be scary enough that Stalin wouldn't try anything</p>

<p>Yes it's used in lots of places, unfortunately I believe that capitalism incentivises the use of these technologies for things which exploit and kill...so that's what it gets used for more than the things that do good.</p>

<p>I saw earlier in a conversation that I am not very typical, and neither is our CEO, who is funding the Topos institute and is the reason for their stance against a bunch of modern bad stuff by big companies, so maybe we have a chance. :)  I always have been pretty extreme left-wing, so is he, so is Ross Duncan, the 2nd highest scientist in the company, so maybe we have a chance; if there is going to be a problem it's the Trotsky vs Bakounin vs Lenin thing.

<p>In 1950 Life magazine quoted the great Hungarian-American physicist John Von Neumann, co-father of both the atom bomb and the digital computer, advocating immediate pre-emptive nuclear war against Russia: “If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today? If you say today at 5 o’clock, I say why not one o’clock?” He was hardly alone. Generals and members of Congress were making the same arguments.</p>

<p>I got this, "big disjunction" from Borceux, or Benabou, or...from other old people.  The Manhatten project was not just an isolated nucleus I remember from their stories, but involved many other branches of US Science, and that's how the two of them got involved; they worked on he obligatory stuff during the day, and other stuff at night.  I am pretty sure of this story.  I'll check for details with people...</p>

<p>I think it will hopefully get us closer to understanding why we fuck up so much.  The world is too cartesian, as advocated by many of the fathers of category theory.  Cartesian means borders between nations, genders, ethnicities, etc.  (and punks vs normal people in my days)   I see the quantum paradigm as a  way to blur those borders, and understand the fluidity and potential of richness vs compartments.</p>

<p>I removed the message, as it was only a bad joke that didn't need to be made. I think one of the differences that people are not paying attention to is that in Europe there are, besides individual countries' NSF-like funders such as EPSRC, the EU, and their frameworks. While in the USA there's this pretense of commercial innovation, but actually the infrastructure work has always been paid by the military:  the silicon chips, the internet,  even the GPU revolution (that we tend to say came about because of the porn -- and the games) was originally supported by the military. I understand that when we accept their money, we give them some credibility that I wish I didn't have to give. But I also think that the money they spent on CT is a dent in the money they spent on killing robots and other technologies much more clearly lethal. I am with Bob that if the money has no strings attached, I will take it.</p>

<p>FWIW I appreciate much more the detailed and honest anecdotes of actual funding examples (eg Bob, John), than people saying "No, and no" (for example) and then taking O(100) posts of discussion to then clarify they are <em>not actually against funding,</em> but against people telling themselves little stories to justify taking funding so they can sleep comfortably at night (and I mean that in both senses).</p>

<p>I personally am willing, <em>and have,</em> taken a manual job when funding ran out, being paid ~$1.20 per package delivered, pre-tax. I now have a bigger family and also no second, part-time income coming in, so it will probably make things quite difficult if I have to resort to that again. There is no hypothetical for me about having to resort to leaving academica for lack of funding, since I will be gone by the end of the year, and I as yet have no plan, and I have commitments to my extended family here and so moving elsewhere for a university job is not an option. The only other major employer of mathematicians in my city is ... guess who. So I appreciate being told constructive stories by people who struggled through managing to build a career.</p>

<p>I would like to share this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/scientist.pdf">The Responsibility of the Scientist Today</a>, Alexandre Grothendieck, 1970</li>
</ul>
<p>Grothendieck posits that scientists have a responsibility to humanity as a whole,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist, as the principal architect of technological progress, must assume a major part of the responsibility for the unprecedented dangers that modern technology has posed for mankind.  Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious "gray matter", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming "helplessness" or "personal insecurity" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate "passively" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on "pure" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the "military manna" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>
<p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>I respect this POV but strongly disagree with the idea that military R&amp;D is a bad thing in its own right, to say nothing of my belief that it is by far the greatest catalyst for technological development

<p>Einstein's willingness to collaborate with the US military led to the development and use of nuclear weapons. I hope we can learn from his mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to make sure everyone what actually happened here.  As usual, I'm not secretly trying to make some point: when I want to make a point I try to make it directly.  I just think it's good to know the history.  "Willingness to collaborate with the military" is a somewhat odd way to describe what Einstein did.</p>
<p>Briefly: during WWII the physicist Leo Szilard spent a lot of time sitting in his bathtub pondering nuclear fission, which had been discovered by the German chemist Hahn and the German Jewish physicist Lise Meitner in 1938.</p>
<p>He realized that it could be used to make a bomb - which may sound obvious, but is not really: it's not trivial to build a nuclear weapon.   He realized that the Nazis would try to do this - which turned out to be true: the Nazi bomb project was led by Heisenberg.    And he decided that the US had to build its own bomb, or at least look into whether it was really possible.</p>
<p>So he decided to write a letter to president Roosevelt advocating this.  But he knew Roosevelt wouldn't listen to him, so he decide to enlist the help of the most famous physicist in the world, the only one whose letter Roosevelt might read: Einstein.</p>
<p>And so they wrote a letter to Roosevelt, and after a while Roosevelt started the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Einstein wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project at all... except for starting it, which of course is huge: I'm not trying to minimize that!</p>

<p>Here's the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August 2nd, 1939</p>
<p>F.D. Roosevelt,<br>
President of the United States,<br>
White House<br>
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:</p>
<p>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</p>
<p>The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.</p>
<p>In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:</p>
<p>a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.</p>
<p>b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Einstein never worked on the Manhattan Project; indeed he was denied a security clearance in 1940 because of his pacifist beliefs. He later had misgivings about his role in creating the Manhattan Project, saying, “Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in develop­ing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing for the bomb.”</p>

<p>I respect this POV but am on record as strongly disagreeing with the premise that military R&amp;D is a bad thing. I think it’s a huge boon to society on balance. You can have vicious conflicts without any particular technological sophistication but you can’t have mRNA vaccines or the internet or self-driving cars or interplanetary exploration without military R&amp;D.</p>

<p>Right, there are different forms funding can take. Jade had a close second-hand view of John and I working on this DARPA project where they had a project, and we joined in on it, via the company Metron. This is very different than just getting handed a bunch of money to do what you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, you never get handed money to do <em>whatever</em> you like.  You have to write grant applications and at least <em>claim</em> you're going to work on some "hot topic".   People who repeatedly get grants tend to be ones that succeed in doing approximately what they claimed they'd do.  So the whole grantsmanship game - which dominates the sciences these days - really pushes people toward "hot topics".</p>
<p>But you're right about this: what you and I had was not a grant, it was a <em>subcontract</em> - so we were being bossed around more.</p>

<p>The UK did a very smart bit of cold war strategy, which is that <em>all</em> of its launch-ready nukes are on submarines. (That system's called Trident, which is a really good name). That very strongly discourages being the target of a preemptive strike. The place that's up the road from Glasgow is where the nuclear-armed submarines come into dock</p>

<p>I know that us discussing this here on Zulip isn't going to have a big impact on how government funding reaches researchers in the short term, but if boycotting military funding whenever possible represents an eventual positive move towards taking military structures out of the equation, that seems like a positive reason to do so.</p>

<p>So one thing I have been told by them, is that they want certain things out in the open rather than in secret in some Russian secret lab.  With our DisCoCat funding that must have been the case.  AFOSR recently also tweeted a big picture of me playing guitar stating that they were proud about once funding me and that this work has contributed to a thing in industry now.  Here's the tweet:<br>

How should one interpret that?  The work we did was all the work with Mehrnoosh, Martha Lewis, Dan Marsden and Dimitri Kartsaklis on DisCoCat, very well known to you,  and the 1st QNLP paper with Will Zeng, leading to my CQC team.  Thanks to the money this is now a big area in ACT as well.  </p>

<p>I know that us discussing this here on Zulip isn't going to have a big impact on how government funding reaches researchers in the short term, but if boycotting military funding whenever possible represents an eventual positive move towards taking military structures out of the equation, that seems like a positive reason to do so.</p>

<p>It's the simple cartesian vs non-cartesian point of view.  Lawvere developed much of his category theory from a Leninist point of view.  But that was a very Cartesian point of view.  Embracing the world to be truly monoidal, gives a different view on humanity, at least for me.  So what I was referring to was more the acceptance of nature being non-cartesian.

<p>Not all rich people are like that.  I know some were it is the other way around: being rich enables one to do good things.  We talk all the time how ultimately CQC can contribute to a better world, where the big tech companies now messed-up big time.</p>
<p>I have never heard them talk about "their goals" when talking to academia.  They have their own research labs for that.  I don't think that I am a complete moron without any ability to gage intent of the people I am talking to.  And really, I never experienced bad intent.</p>

<p>I wouldn't blame Einstein for that.

The question is whether knowing this fact, was crucial for developing atomic bombs.  And I don't think so!   What was really crucial was research on radioactivity and later nuclear physics, and Einstein didn't do any of this, as far as I know.</p>
<p>If you want to blame someone, blame:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pierre Becquerel for discovering radioactivity: "By May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marie and Pierre Curie for discovering and studying new radioactive elements like radium and polonium ; they shared the 1903 Nobel with Becquerel for work on radioactivity.  Marie died of cancer from doing experiments with these materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ernest Rutherford for inventing the concept of half-life, and discovering that in radioactive decay one element would turn into another by emitting alpha and beta particles.  In 1917 Rutherford carried out the first "nuclear reaction": bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles and turning it into oxygen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otto Hahn for discovering nuclear fission in 1938 and Lise Meitner for figuring out what was going on: a nucleus of uranium bombarded with neutrons could split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy and also more neutrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frédéric Joliot-Curie, the husband of Marie and Pierre's daughter, for letting the world know that this could create a chain reaction.   Leo Szilard actually came up with the idea in 1933, and in 1934 he patented the idea of a nuclear reactor.  But he was smart enough to keep quiet about it.   When Enrico Fermi (in New York) and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (in Paris) started doing experiments on nuclear fission, he tried to persuade them to not publish anything about the idea of a chain reaction, lest the Nazis become aware of it.    Fermi agreed to self-censor.   Joliot-Curie did not: he published an article in <em>Nature</em> saying that when a uranium atom split, it released more neutrons that it took to split that uranium atom!   The idea of a nuclear bomb was then apparent to any intelligent physicist.  Leo Szilard became so scared of the Nazis developing a bomb that in 1938 he decided to contact Roosevelt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Werner Heisenberg for agreeing to lead the Nazi atomic bomb project.   He later argued that he deliberately <em>slowed down</em> this project, and there's even some evidence for this, but people will argue endlessly about it, and Bohr broke off his friendship with Heisenberg over this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fermi, Bohr and all the other physicists who joined the Manhattan Project - this is a very long list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Einstein was a bit player in all this <em>except</em> that he went along with Szilard and wrote the letter to Roosevelt.   </p>
<p>The myth that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E = mc^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> was the key to the atomic bomb came later.  It certainly <em>helped</em> people figure out things about fission, but the things I just listed helped <em>much</em> more.   Einstein was off thinking about other things while these people were paving the way for nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>I'd extend this to say that neither Becquerel, Marie and Pierre Curie, Hahn, Szilard, Fermi should be held responsible for the bomb, since none of them explictly pushed for their science to be developed into a weapon. Even people closer to the Manhattan project could be excused: as John reported, many of them were very scared the Nazis could get there first (a very reasonable doubt) and at that point game theoretic incentives start to play a role, so that for the Allies developing the bomb <em>was the only option</em>. Using it, maybe not that much, that's another problem.<br>
But yeah, I think these are extremely complex problems and putting blame on people is wrong, since it oversimplifies.<br>
The good thing to do was non-proliferation treaties. But it takes a lot of work to arrive to a point where that's an option on the table. I don't think the 1930s were ready, and the bomb became inevitable.</p>

<p>Consensus is becoming an increasingly difficult state to achieve with the changes to media.  There are many, powerful forces that are trying to achieve this disintegration of consensus.  American consensus is particularly under assault.</p>
<p>I know for sure, that there are many countries out there that would love for the broader global population to come to the consensus that there is no future in American global power.  I see this event as truly disastrous to a world that can be taken seriously or enjoyed thoroughly.</p>

<p>Also, the <em>really</em> bad thing that I would like to stop is abuse of military power, not the military funding ACT.  So the correct question is not "how can ACT people help keep the military out of ACT?"  It's "how can ACT people help stop abuse of military power?"  If you think that the latter question reduces to the former, that is something that can be argued, but it is not true <em>a priori</em>.  If you advocate rejecting military funding as a tactic, then I think the right question is "how effective is this tactic for stopping the abuse of military power?"</p>

<p>Jade is literally advocating for the removal of scientific input to the foundation of American global power.  We are way past the point to having the luxury of not caring.</p>
<p>The idea that the concern is couched in terms of a universal removal of this support from all militaries is not a reasonable expectation.  That goes back to John's post about how Einstein sent the letter saying the Germans will get to the bomb first.  The other idea, that fundamental science goes straight and quick to the applications, is also untenable.</p>

<p>Okay, so you <em>are</em> thinking about these things!   Good!</p>
<p>I agree with you: European and especially Chinese researchers should think just as carefully about their involvement in the military as American ones.   I say "especially Chinese" because the possibility of a war between China and the US in the next few decades is a real one, whereas it seems less likely the EU will initiate a big war like that.  But it's probaby better for <em>everyone</em> to think about the consequences of taking military funding, not just cross their fingers and hope their country's military doesn't go to war.</p>

<p>In Engineering military funding is not going away – it's a lost cause there. But maybe math and CS are different. (Also my personal examinations of such things does not mean that I think it should be a prerequisite for being a researcher in any field, some people just don't care about politics AT ALL)</p>

<p>I'd extend this to say that neither Becquerel, Marie and Pierre Curie, Hahn, Szilard, Fermi should be held responsible for the bomb, since none of them explicitly pushed for their science to be developed into a weapon. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree about Becquerel and the Curies.  But Szilard was the one who came up with the idea of telling Roosevelt to start investigating the possibility of creating an atomic bomb: that was the start of the Manhattan Project.  And Fermi was one of the principal leaders of the Manhattan Project!  </p>
<p>So I think Szilard and Fermi very much have some responsibility for creating the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>This is not the same question as whether they did something evil.  That's a harder question.</p>
<p>To my mind the real evil in this vicinity was the US and British policy of winning the war by demolishing whole cities, killing vast numbers of innocent civilians.  </p>
<p>An early example was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II">bombing of Hamburg in July 1943</a> by US and British forces, which killed 37,000 civilians and wounded 180,000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A thermal column of wind generated heat in excess of 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, melting trolley windows and the asphalt in streets, the wind uprooting trees. When people crossed a street, their feet stuck in the melted asphalt; they tried to extricate themselves with their hands, only to find them stuck as well. They remained on all fours screaming. Small children lay like "fried eels" on the pavement. The firestorm sucked all the oxygen out of the city.</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Hamburg_(book)">Martin Middlebrook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later came the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground">firebombing of Dresden in February 1945</a>, where they - or should I say "we"? - dropped 3,900 tons of bombs and incendiary devices on the city, leading to a firestorm that killed about 25,000 people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere, everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.</em> — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground">Lothar Metzger, survivor</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then came the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo">bombing of Tokyo in March 1945</a>.   279 planes flew over the city and dropped 1,665 tons of bombs. Most were 500-pound cluster bombs, each one releasing 38 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of about 2000 feet. These bomblets punched through the roofs of people's houses or landed on the ground and ignited 3.5 seconds later, throwing out jets of flaming, sticky napalm.  Tokyo was a densely packed city, largely made of <em>paper</em>.</p>
<p>The planes also dropped 100-pound jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bombs that ignited upon impact. The city's fire departments were overwhelmed, and the individual fires started by the bombs joined to create a huge conflagration that destroyed 16 square miles of the city. Over 100,000 people died — nobody knows how many, and both the Japanese and Americans had reasons to underestimate the casualties. </p>

Somewhere between 120,000 and 226,000 died.  Horrible!   But just the culmination of a horrible way of winning a war by treating civilians as worthless rats to be burnt.</p>

<p>The main reason I said all that stuff is that I've found a lot more people know about Hiroshima and Nagasaki than the bombings of  Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo.

<p>John has brought up the atrocities of the second world war with a bit of an emphasis on what terrible things the US and Britain did. Americans are the first to point out how American aggression and intervention is unjust. That very fact is why I believe that the ongoing soft and military powers of the US are welcome. Life has been very good for a lot of people for a long time, and where life is not good, the US and EU have been quick to condemn those countries.  There is no justification for scientists to pull out of the maintenance of this state of affairs.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I was not bringing up those atrocities mainly to  say that the US and Britain are especially evil... I stay away from such broad judgements.  I was bringing up those atrocities to point out that the "atom bomb" was not a unique stand-alone sort of thing: it was part of a general strategy of bombing cities in such a way as to start massive fires.

<p>I've also just spent a lot of time reading about the history of 20th-century physics and the world wars, and how they interacted.   I consider myself mainly a mathematical physicist, so I've always been interested in this time period, where physicists made a big difference in world affairs, and Jewish scientists chased out of Germany helped build the bomb and jump-started physics in the US.    The glorious discoveries of quantum mechanics and relativity are mixed in quite inextricably with very dark, horrific events.</p>

<p>As for why the US military is a dominant channel for scientific funding, it's mainly because the US has a strategy of maintaining military dominance via technological superiority.  There are lots of documents about this; it's completely deliberate and explicit.   <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/05/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-10-countries-combined">The US spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined</a>, and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual spending on defense science and technology has “grown substantially” over the past four decades from $2.3 billion in FY1978 to $13.4 billion in FY2018 or by nearly 90% in constant dollars, according to a new report from the Congressional Research Service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(from <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2018/02/defense-sci-tech/">here</a>).   For comparison, it looks like the National Science Foundation got <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/final-2018-budget-deal-should-help-national-science-foundation-2019-too">$7.767 billion</a> in 2018.</p>

<p>Something I'd like to see a bit more discussion on is the question about the difference between accepting funding from the US military and the US government. They have the same commander in chief, pretty much all the terrible things the US military does is because the government told them to do it, and as far as I understand it, the people in charge of giving funding can hop between doing this for the military and doing this for the government. Why then would it be morally acceptable to accept a government grant, but not a military grant?</p>
<p>I could see a difference when you would be actively cooperating with military personel, as then your knowledge is directly contributing to the military, but if the situation is like Bob's where it is basically a cash-only transfer, why would the difference matter?</p>

<p>The irony is that lobbying to divorce ostensibly non-military research from the military would improve the situation for both military and non-military research interests. At the risk of really kicking the heat in this discussion up a notch, I would compare this to the concept of defunding the police. The military is not a body fit for the responsibility of determining the entire scope of scientific research, and if it were relieved of that responsibility it could focus on funding the research that directly benefits the services it provides.</p>

<p>Just to to put this in perspective of the other discussion here, with help of evil funding, there now are Jamie Vicary's group, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh's, Miriam Backens', Martha Lewis', Chris Heunen's, Aleks Kissinger's, Vladimir Zamdziev's, etc. now that I retired from academia, and Samson will be retiring too.

<p>Sorry, I'm late to the conversation. A few considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fermi is absolutely responsible for the bomb. He was one of the leaders of the Manhattan project, he never regretted a thing about it, and he was actually also part of the team that evaluated which cities would make the best target for the bomb. He literally picked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's a slippery slope but it's difficult to make more mass murderer points than this if you are a scientist.</li>
<li>The US global power should really be curtailed (if only T_T). No offense but since 2001 US foreign policy didn't bring anything but problems, at least here in the EU.  I have been provocative about this many times, but I'll say it again: From an EU perspective, Trump was a blessing. Having the US without any real foreign policy for 4 years has been simply awesome for us. And I'm pretty sure that now that you have someone with a brain in power again, our relationships with Russia (that is our neighbour, btw) will just get much worse.</li>
<li>The US is still the global leader in the world. If you think nations like China are now in control you are being naive. There are many reasons for this, but the main ones are that the US have the biggest military in the world and much more importantly total control of the oceans, which are fundamental commercial routes.</li>
<li>I don't like rationalistic arguments like the ones <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280784">@Joshua Meyers</span> was doing. I can understand that rationalism is very appealing for mathematicians, but it leads very easily to discard moral arguments, which in some cases are fundamental. The  result of applying a rationalist way of thinking in fields that should benefit also from a moral judgement can be seen in projects like effective altruism, which seem rationally sound but end up being just a discriminatory bollocks shitshow. With this I'm not saying that one shouldn't better motivate things, I'm just saying that analyzing moral-related issues like they were theorems can be dangerous.</li>

<p>Also, there are very rich people that want to do good, it's true. But I still think that the social cost of a billionaire defeats the possible benefits multiple times. Even people like Bill Gates, that donated a lot of their fortune to philantropic causes, have probably destroyed lives, careers, enterprises for a sum that was orders of magnitude higher than the one they donated. This is intrinsic to capitalism: To get that rich you have to engage in ruthless business practices, and more importantly actively fuel a system that is literally eating the planet away. And this is when you are a "good" billionaire. When you are a bad one you are just like Peter Thiel that has Moldbug and Land as his favourite ideologues, which says it all.</p>

I can understand that rationalism is very appealing for mathematicians, but it leads very easily to discard moral arguments, which in some cases are fundamental. The  result of applying a rationalist way of thinking in fields that should benefit also from a moral judgement can be seen in projects like effective altruism, which seem rationally sound but end up being just a discriminatory bollocks shitshow. With this I'm not saying that one shouldn't better motivate things, I'm just saying that analyzing moral-related issues like they were theorems can be dangerous.</li>

<p>Sorry I don't really know what to do with this criticism.  Of course I agree that a purely rationalist way of thinking can be dangerous, but you haven't really shown me that that is happening here.  Can you give a criticism that is more specific to the particular arguments I actually gave?  Also, btw, I don't know whether you think I am arguing for taking military funding, but if you do then that is a sign that you don't understand what I'm saying.</p>

<p>I don't think you are advocating for military funding, but you asked explanations about why/how "I don't like the military -&gt; I don't take military funding" can be a good strategy.

<p>I can give you a reason why this is so: The idea of thinking about solving issues in rational/game theoretic terms has been traditionally championed, for instance, by the realist school of international politics. Their idea was "The best way to decide how to act internationally is by interpreting the world like a sort of competitive game". This kind of school started with Bismarck, up until Kissinger, and there are still many people that think that way</p>

<p>The reason is that being "realist" gives you a very convenient argument for suspending moral judgement in service of some "greater good". The (obviously extreme) example of this may be the usual "If we kill all of our enemies, and show absolutely no mercy to anyone, then we will have peace."</p>

<p>It clearly works, because it reduces the problem you are facing to a non-problem. If you factor moral judgement in, then the non-trivial solutions like the one above don't really work anymore</p>

<p>Let me stress another important thing: No one, aside some truly mentally deranged people, does bad stuff while knowing that the stuff they are doing is bad. What I mean is that, more often than not, even the people doing the worst things one can imagine will think they were acting in good faith. <br>
For instance, and this is quite well documented, in a case of aggression between people you will see how both parties will say that they were acting defensively. "I stabbed him because he was punching me", "I punched him because he insulted me", "I insulted him because he was looking at me in a bad way", and so on. If you unpack any kind of violent behavior, you'll find out how most of the time both parties involved are convinced that they were acting in good faith, and were somehow justified</p>

<p>This is precisely why I do believe that moral reasoning must be central in discussing these issues. It really is something one has to constantly keep in check. "Am I acting morally here?" is the first question one should always ask himself, way before "Am I acting rationally?" Cos the former is much more difficult to fix than the latter. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Like it or not, if you want to be effective at doing <em>anything</em> you need to think about your strategy for doing it.  <em>A fortiori</em> if you want to be effective about doing something <em>good</em>.  I'm not claiming that this is sufficient, merely necessary.  You also have to think about what is good to do in the first place, as well as whether your strategy has harmful effects which outweigh the good of what it is a strategy for.</p>

<li>The US global power should really be curtailed (if only T_T). No offense but since 2001 US foreign policy didn't bring anything but problems, at least here in the EU.  I have been provocative about this many times, but I'll say it again: From an EU perspective, Trump was a blessing. Having the US without any real foreign policy for 4 years has been simply awesome for us. And I'm pretty sure that now that you have someone with a brain in power again, our relationships with Russia (that is our neighbour, btw) will just get much worse.</li>

<p>I tried looking up this idea that Eu-russia relations improved during Trump.  I only found an Economist article that suggested a thaw around 2019 but it was paywalled.</p>
<p>I don't believed the receding of US foreign policy improved EU-russia relations.  The reason is that I believe, instead, that they focused their attention on the personal manipulation they could achieve through social media.  This eventually led to the UK leaving the European Union.  That is an incredible win for Russia.  They dismantled the EU.</p>
<p>If American power were to recede, don't you feel that this would inevitably lead to the rise in China's power.  My country has just labeled them as effecting a genocide right now.  I am not sure you understand what that means to most people.</p>

<p>I have been trying to consider this idea that all scientists, globally, could just somehow agree to act highly ethically, say, for the next hundred years.  It is impossible.....but, let's just approach it from an idealized point of view.  How could it be achieved?  What would it mean on a personal level for Scientists?  How would they incorporate it into their work?  I mean, in just the simplest sense, there is already a whole branch of science which deals with ethical questions.  Take life science.  Is it really just a matter of not taking grants from the military?  That doesn't make sense, since once their work is published, technologists working for the military would find applications.  So that puts the burden on the scientist to mentally strangle themselves.</p>

<p>Personally, I think if scientists want to be "highly ethical for the next hundred years", they need to focus a lot of attention on the Anthropocene.   Global warming is the most obvious part of this, but it's really a <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/balsillie/balsillie_what.pdf">much bigger thing</a>, and only with a lot of help from scientists will we get through this without a seriously damaged biosphere.   Of course politicians, and people in industry, and <em>everyone</em> has a crucial part to play, but at present only scientists can actually understand the many ways in which we are pushing up against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries">planetary boundaries</a> and <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change">tipping points</a>, and only scientists have a chance of understanding the advantages and disadvantages of proposed solutions like geoengineering, carbon sequestration, fission and fusion power, solar and wind power, etc.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm not saying scientists should make the decisions: they should learn about the situation, evaluate solutions, and explain all this to everyone else!</p>

<p>It's much easier for scientists and mathematicians than ordinary folks to understand all the issues I just listed: we can read graphs (believe it or not, most people can't), we can read journal articles (most people don't even have access to them, much less know how to read them), we can sense what counts as crackpot science (well, many of us can), and so on.

<p>It now takes 12M $ to train GPT-3 in electricity alone (!) so AI is heading for an ecological disaster.  We hope that our brand of AI which needs exponentially less resources can do something about that.  People in quantum computing are also working on carbon capture.</p>

<p>Scientists have special moral obligations because we have special tools and skills.   It's like how firefighters have more responsibility for putting out fires than other people - not because they have special access to some divine truth, but because they have special access to fire trucks and hoses.</p>

<p>I do agree with John. And fields like data science and AI are really sensitive at the moment. For instance, a friend of mine working in AI told me in some AI-related fields it is becoming customary to make datasets and code available only to the reviewers, in fear that new advancements may be used by rogue actors (states or whatnot) to automate discrimination, persecution of political opponents and so on. So I'd definitely say that scientists have some very peculiar responsibilities, especially the ones working in some ethically sensitive fields.</p>

<p>No, not at this stage. But one day it may well be. We are still building the ACT fundamentals, but it's not unreasonable to think that one day the categorical approach will result in breakthroughs in various fields. This is already the case for quantum protocols, for instance. In such cases, some of the things we do may become problematic. It's good that we talk about these issues now that the community is still reasonably small, there aren't huge ethical implications in what we do (yet) and things are more or less under control. Hopefully, we will be able to understand and sort ethical issues now, so that when they will come we will be prepared (in truth I think you can never be prepared for this stuff, but giving it some thought helps anyway).</p>

<p>Also we could build strong moral foundations in the community from the beginning. The same applies to inclusivity, I believe. Let's normalize good things, and good things will be the norm.</p>

<p>This looks like a really special feature of machine learning that it's possible to do this. It's quite a lot like showing someone your car but not giving them the key so they can't take it for a joyride (and technically they also can't know for certain that it's not broken down). Our field is way more conceptual, I can't imagine having an equivalent of "not giving them the key"</p>

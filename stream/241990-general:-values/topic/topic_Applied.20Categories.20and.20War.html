<p>A while back, there was a discussion about the ethics of accepting funding from military sources. Although, not strictly brought into that discussion, are there military applications of category theory? If so what might they be? Are those methods strictly to increase lethal engagement, or could they also be used in so-called "hybrid warfare"? Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
<p>It feels to me like the questions I'm asking are a lot like those asked of "the bomb". But I also could be overthinking things...</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>Maybe, but militaries have been promising less messy, more surgical conflicts for years. And I don't think smart bombs can overcome physics. A bunker buster is always going to cause a lot of damage, regardless of how accurate and precise it is. It also depends on a willingness to use them surgically. For instance, the current war in Ukraine shows both extremes: The Ukrainians, with their HIMARS have shown the capability to do surgical strikes on ammo depots and command centers, while on the opposite extreme, the Russian military has shown a willingness to use their advanced weapons on civilian infrastructure and on residential targets.</p>

<p>There could be, in that raising these questions in earshot of actors from hostile nations could start an intellectual arms race. Hence my apprehension.</p>

<p>Sorry, I was going to say more but I got distracted.  I was going to continue and say that if category theorists help the military with specific projects like CASCADE they will be helping develop specifically <em>military</em> applications of category theory.  This is why I quit working on CASCADE: they began the program using an example of organizing search and rescue missions in a yacht race in the Caribbean, but then it changed to more clearly military applications.  </p>
<p>If category theorists work with the military it will also tend to help keep their military ahead of competing militaries, and civilians, in the development of generally applicable tools.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say but I'm still busy!</p>

<p>Anyway, to these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pandora's box has been opened, and it's called "science, technology and mathematics".    It can <br>
cause untold amounts of suffering - or good.  Research in these areas can inadvertently cause immense suffering.   There is an arms race between nations in all areas of science, technology and mathematics.</p>
<p>Category theory is part of this, and I don't think it can be cleanly separated out.   That is, if everyone doing category theory quit now, the effects would be rather subtle.    As people never tire of telling category theorists, almost anything you can do with category theory can also be done without it.  The difference is mainly that with category theory it's gets done in a clearer, more generalizable and less error-prone way.</p>

<p>The military will eventually - and often quite promptly - use any sort of applied math that anyone comes up with.   So you can decide this is fine, or that it's unavoidable, and keep working on applied category theory... or avoid working on applied category theory, or avoid working on <em>explicitly military</em> applications of category theory, or for that matter <em>embrace</em> explicitly military applications of category theory: all these are self-consistent positions that people take.</p>
<p>Here's my personal position: I want to pursue applications of category theory to human health, climate change, etc., because  I can actually make a difference there, and perhaps a good difference.  These fields may otherwise be a bit slow in adopting categorical methods.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was thinking of this sort of stuff in terms of three mathematical keys that I discussed publicly at the time: CT (for compositionality), topology (and some global geometry, for global properties), and statistical physics (for emergent properties). Imagine a bunch of gizmos that the military wants to coordinate. You might want to model each as a sensor, actuator, and interface. That's a 2-simplex. You might glue interfaces and maybe constrain actuators. Now you're making a simplicial set. There might be some function over local groups of gizmos. Now you have a local section in a sheaf. You might want to engineer a behavior under an ensemble of environmental conditions. Now you're doing statistical physics. Finally you might want to assemble subsystems or groups into systems or teams, or you might want to fuse data or compose various protocols. Now you're doing CT.</p>

<p>I'll quote from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1</a>: "operadic formulations or realizations of data structures for multirobot systems such as the one sketched here are especially desirable because they hold the promise of engineering distinct functionalities in a coherent way. For example, detailed missions can be encoded using flowgraphs [19], constraints can be encoded using weighted maximum satisfiability and/or linear temporal logic formulas, teams can be encoded using simplicial sets [17], etc., and each of these data structures has an associated notion of operad."</p>

<p><em>On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me. “And we were, like, ‘Oh, dear, this is not good.’ ” Musk told Kahl that the vivid illustration of how technology he had designed for peaceful ends was being used to wage war gave him pause.</em></p>
<p>I would guess that quite a few of Starlink's developers were distressed by the prospects of <em>not</em> using it to wage war. Certainly I would have been distressed in such a position.</p>

<p><em>Musk’s sympathies appeared to be manifesting on the battlefield. One day, Ukrainian forces advancing into contested areas in the south found themselves suddenly unable to communicate. “We were very close to the front line,” Mykola, the signal-corps soldier, told me. “We crossed this border and the Starlink stopped working.” The consequences were immediate. “Communications became dead, units were isolated. When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. American and Ukrainian officials told me they believed that SpaceX had cut the connectivity via geofencing, cordoning off areas of access.</em></p>

<p>Is this discussion off-topic or has category theory made it into low earth orbit while maintaining a low profile?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span> Are you suggesting that you want connections in this discussion to be between war and category theory per se versus just to math and tech that uses math? In that even you may not be aware that folks at NASA and at various universities are doing all manner of category theory as part of a delay-tolerant networking effort involving Starlink, see e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H_Rtqw2RqM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H_Rtqw2RqM</a></p>

<p>FWIW your first link contains the passage <em>Reason, by itself, can lay out a road map to peace or to war, to tolerance or to persecution, depending on what the reasoner wants.</em> While some might argue for nonviolence no matter what, I have a hard time imagining Jesus Christ himself doing that instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">flipping over tables and whipping folks</a> when circumstances warranted.</p>

<p>A while back, there was a discussion about the ethics of accepting funding from military sources. Although, not strictly brought into that discussion, are there military applications of category theory? If so what might they be? Are those methods strictly to increase lethal engagement, or could they also be used in so-called "hybrid warfare"? Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
<p>It feels to me like the questions I'm asking are a lot like those asked of "the bomb". But I also could be overthinking things...</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>Maybe, but militaries have been promising less messy, more surgical conflicts for years. And I don't think smart bombs can overcome physics. A bunker buster is always going to cause a lot of damage, regardless of how accurate and precise it is. It also depends on a willingness to use them surgically. For instance, the current war in Ukraine shows both extremes: The Ukrainians, with their HIMARS have shown the capability to do surgical strikes on ammo depots and command centers, while on the opposite extreme, the Russian military has shown a willingness to use their advanced weapons on civilian infrastructure and on residential targets.</p>

<p>There could be, in that raising these questions in earshot of actors from hostile nations could start an intellectual arms race. Hence my apprehension.</p>

<p>Sorry, I was going to say more but I got distracted.  I was going to continue and say that if category theorists help the military with specific projects like CASCADE they will be helping develop specifically <em>military</em> applications of category theory.  This is why I quit working on CASCADE: they began the program using an example of organizing search and rescue missions in a yacht race in the Caribbean, but then it changed to more clearly military applications.  </p>
<p>If category theorists work with the military it will also tend to help keep their military ahead of competing militaries, and civilians, in the development of generally applicable tools.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say but I'm still busy!</p>

<p>Anyway, to these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pandora's box has been opened, and it's called "science, technology and mathematics".    It can <br>
cause untold amounts of suffering - or good.  Research in these areas can inadvertently cause immense suffering.   There is an arms race between nations in all areas of science, technology and mathematics.</p>
<p>Category theory is part of this, and I don't think it can be cleanly separated out.   That is, if everyone doing category theory quit now, the effects would be rather subtle.    As people never tire of telling category theorists, almost anything you can do with category theory can also be done without it.  The difference is mainly that with category theory it's gets done in a clearer, more generalizable and less error-prone way.</p>

<p>The military will eventually - and often quite promptly - use any sort of applied math that anyone comes up with.   So you can decide this is fine, or that it's unavoidable, and keep working on applied category theory... or avoid working on applied category theory, or avoid working on <em>explicitly military</em> applications of category theory, or for that matter <em>embrace</em> explicitly military applications of category theory: all these are self-consistent positions that people take.</p>
<p>Here's my personal position: I want to pursue applications of category theory to human health, climate change, etc., because  I can actually make a difference there, and perhaps a good difference.  These fields may otherwise be a bit slow in adopting categorical methods.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was thinking of this sort of stuff in terms of three mathematical keys that I discussed publicly at the time: CT (for compositionality), topology (and some global geometry, for global properties), and statistical physics (for emergent properties). Imagine a bunch of gizmos that the military wants to coordinate. You might want to model each as a sensor, actuator, and interface. That's a 2-simplex. You might glue interfaces and maybe constrain actuators. Now you're making a simplicial set. There might be some function over local groups of gizmos. Now you have a local section in a sheaf. You might want to engineer a behavior under an ensemble of environmental conditions. Now you're doing statistical physics. Finally you might want to assemble subsystems or groups into systems or teams, or you might want to fuse data or compose various protocols. Now you're doing CT.</p>

<p>I'll quote from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1</a>: "operadic formulations or realizations of data structures for multirobot systems such as the one sketched here are especially desirable because they hold the promise of engineering distinct functionalities in a coherent way. For example, detailed missions can be encoded using flowgraphs [19], constraints can be encoded using weighted maximum satisfiability and/or linear temporal logic formulas, teams can be encoded using simplicial sets [17], etc., and each of these data structures has an associated notion of operad."</p>

<p><em>On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me. “And we were, like, ‘Oh, dear, this is not good.’ ” Musk told Kahl that the vivid illustration of how technology he had designed for peaceful ends was being used to wage war gave him pause.</em></p>
<p>I would guess that quite a few of Starlink's developers were distressed by the prospects of <em>not</em> using it to wage war. Certainly I would have been distressed in such a position.</p>

<p><em>Musk’s sympathies appeared to be manifesting on the battlefield. One day, Ukrainian forces advancing into contested areas in the south found themselves suddenly unable to communicate. “We were very close to the front line,” Mykola, the signal-corps soldier, told me. “We crossed this border and the Starlink stopped working.” The consequences were immediate. “Communications became dead, units were isolated. When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. American and Ukrainian officials told me they believed that SpaceX had cut the connectivity via geofencing, cordoning off areas of access.</em></p>

<p>FWIW your first link contains the passage <em>Reason, by itself, can lay out a road map to peace or to war, to tolerance or to persecution, depending on what the reasoner wants.</em> While some might argue for nonviolence no matter what, I have a hard time imagining Jesus Christ himself doing that instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">flipping over tables and whipping folks</a> when circumstances warranted.</p>

<p>My intent is not to reinvigorate a debate, just to say that historically a VAST number of technologies funded by governments (not just USA and not just DOD funding elements) have been what is often called "dual use". This isn't unique to applications of category theory or math by any means. The discussed CASCADE program is a good example, since the dual use is search and rescue (SAR) but also <em>combat</em> search and rescue (CSAR). Dual use is often merely a change in application context and so very little if anything can be done in practice to avoid contributing to the crossover by those who might be concerned. </p>
<p>Yes, I would say mosaic is the quintessential <em>compositional</em> force package design concept... so very relevant. For better or worse, there are a ton of possible applications of CT to military theory, doctrine, and practice. For instance, I think some of the constructions in categorical systems theory and cybernetics could be extended to model a more general theory of interacting adversarial systems. Another dual use arises: military (obviously) and competing firms within a marketplace. Not to mention applications to model a more general competition between national power structures (ideas like DIMEFIL) in which a military plays only a marginal (though most visible) role.</p>

<p>If they want to eliminate a precise leader who appears to live in the same building than you, you prefer that they send special forces to captur him rather than destroying the whole building and kill lot of people. It's the way Ben Laden was captured as long as I understand. That's the kind of operations that the US or european countries know how to do, using lot of work on getting information and highly-trained soldiers with high-tech equipment. Compare this to Russia sending their soldiers to certain death by using low-tech "human wave attacks" in Ukrainia. I would prefer being an afghan guy, the US operating in my country, rather than an Ukrainian guy, Russia operating in my country. If they don't even care about the life of their people, they will care  even less about my life.</p>

<p>I recently realized that Zulip allows for muting of threads, which means off-topic (wrt actual category theory math) discussions aren't forced on the larger group. This makes it much easier for me to consider engaging here and there in the fringe threads. That is neither here nor there, just felt like stating it.</p>
<p>I will see if I can briefly offer a satisfactory response through the lens of nuclear deterrence terminology. There is a notion of countervalue and counterforce operations in nuclear deployment. There is no reason the terms can't extend to conventional munition deployment. </p>
<p>In counterforce, strikes are limited to military targets. In countervalue, civilian populace and infrastructure are targeted. One goal of counterforce is to intentionally limit civilian impacts (as strange as it may sound given the nuclear context!). The US broadly applies this counterforce idea... with many, <em>many</em> mistakes no doubt, but generally tries. It's part of the legal framework of US armed conflict: LOAC. [Edit: I should say clearly this has not always been the case in the US, especially with respect to nuclear weapons. Also, I mention US in particular only because that's where I am]</p>
<p>If I imagine myself to be a civilian in a nation under military action by a force practicing counterforce methods, I would want their targeting methods and munitions to be as precise as possible, limiting collateral effects and thus minimizing risk to me, who may not care one bit about the grand geo-political machinations surrounding the conflict. I think this is getting at what the OP was saying. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if I am a civilian in a country subject to attack from a countervalue-oriented nation, I would very much like for their military to have highly ineffective weapons so they are less likely to work on me. </p>
<p>Of course nothing is so simple, and everyone knows these ideas, so often military targets are intentionally placed within civilian areas (even by the "good guys"), like a "human shield" ploy, leading to difficulty in executing a purely counterforce operation. But one can still imagine the "ideal" scenario, as silly as it may seem to consider idealism in war. I would just say that nations vie for interests, and it's hard to avoid conflict in all cases, so one should hope that those responsible for carrying it out study and understand it as formally as possible.</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>I never understand this argument. Think from the perspective of a person in a territory being attacked by an imperial military force. Why would you want their weapons to be more effective?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I didn't answer the question. If I'm attacked by an imperial military force... Hmm... Again I prefer that they kill or capture all the military of my country and not me. Or better, that they destroy all the military equipment of the army of my country, without killing anybody, or something like this, precise and effective, which I'm sure will not kill me, my family and my friends.</p>

<p>Something good will be for example that they take the control of the energy sources, like fuel and electricity, or that they make all electronical devices innefective by making explode a nuclear bomb very high in the sky (I heard that this thing can make all printed circuit boards innefective? ) or that they hack the internet and the bank system of my country...

<p>Sorry, it was still not the question. Making weapons more effective is just a small part of how you can use category theory for instance in the army. I don't think that this is the main thing that interest military today. We already know how to make guns and bombs that do what they are conceived for.</p>

<p><em>Ukraine did want to press forward last year, before the fortifications were built.  It lacked the necessary weapons, and Elon Musk chose to cut Ukraine off from communications.  That move likely extended the war. Because Musk’s decision was based on his internalization of Russian propaganda about nuclear war, and was accompanied by his repetition of that propaganda, he made a nuclear war more likely.  If powerful men convey the message that just talking about nuclear war is enough to win conventional wars, then we will have more countries with nuclear weapons and more conventional wars that can escalate into nuclear ones. Ukraine has been resistant to this line of Russian fearmongering, fortunately for us all.</em></p>

<p>The context was some colleagues was talking about the revoking security clearance scene after watching Oppenheimer with comparison with our cultural revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The imagination of US people is indeed limited.<br>
Revoking some security clearance and expulsion from the project to a well-known university are enough to make the entire academic community mad?<br>
With the security clearance there is even an inspection committee, and Oppenheimer even has an attorney?<br>
The attorney argued these procedures are not legal, not a fair fight, like being beaten up, with injustice?<br>
And the committee even has a two-to-one passage; one of them even wrote a petition of dissent?<br>
Really, don't even talk about McCarthyism to us; your McCarthyism in our country is just child game.</p>

<p>Chinese mathematicians will never ever forget these; and we can't even if we want to because these persecutions have never gone away in our homeland.</p>

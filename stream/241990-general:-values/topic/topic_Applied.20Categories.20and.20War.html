<p>A while back, there was a discussion about the ethics of accepting funding from military sources. Although, not strictly brought into that discussion, are there military applications of category theory? If so what might they be? Are those methods strictly to increase lethal engagement, or could they also be used in so-called "hybrid warfare"? Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
<p>It feels to me like the questions I'm asking are a lot like those asked of "the bomb". But I also could be overthinking things...</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>Maybe, but militaries have been promising less messy, more surgical conflicts for years. And I don't think smart bombs can overcome physics. A bunker buster is always going to cause a lot of damage, regardless of how accurate and precise it is. It also depends on a willingness to use them surgically. For instance, the current war in Ukraine shows both extremes: The Ukrainians, with their HIMARS have shown the capability to do surgical strikes on ammo depots and command centers, while on the opposite extreme, the Russian military has shown a willingness to use their advanced weapons on civilian infrastructure and on residential targets.</p>

<p>There could be, in that raising these questions in earshot of actors from hostile nations could start an intellectual arms race. Hence my apprehension.</p>

<p>Sorry, I was going to say more but I got distracted.  I was going to continue and say that if category theorists help the military with specific projects like CASCADE they will be helping develop specifically <em>military</em> applications of category theory.  This is why I quit working on CASCADE: they began the program using an example of organizing search and rescue missions in a yacht race in the Caribbean, but then it changed to more clearly military applications.  </p>
<p>If category theorists work with the military it will also tend to help keep their military ahead of competing militaries, and civilians, in the development of generally applicable tools.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say but I'm still busy!</p>

<p>Anyway, to these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pandora's box has been opened, and it's called "science, technology and mathematics".    It can <br>
cause untold amounts of suffering - or good.  Research in these areas can inadvertently cause immense suffering.   There is an arms race between nations in all areas of science, technology and mathematics.</p>
<p>Category theory is part of this, and I don't think it can be cleanly separated out.   That is, if everyone doing category theory quit now, the effects would be rather subtle.    As people never tire of telling category theorists, almost anything you can do with category theory can also be done without it.  The difference is mainly that with category theory it's gets done in a clearer, more generalizable and less error-prone way.</p>

<p>The military will eventually - and often quite promptly - use any sort of applied math that anyone comes up with.   So you can decide this is fine, or that it's unavoidable, and keep working on applied category theory... or avoid working on applied category theory, or avoid working on <em>explicitly military</em> applications of category theory, or for that matter <em>embrace</em> explicitly military applications of category theory: all these are self-consistent positions that people take.</p>
<p>Here's my personal position: I want to pursue applications of category theory to human health, climate change, etc., because  I can actually make a difference there, and perhaps a good difference.  These fields may otherwise be a bit slow in adopting categorical methods.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was thinking of this sort of stuff in terms of three mathematical keys that I discussed publicly at the time: CT (for compositionality), topology (and some global geometry, for global properties), and statistical physics (for emergent properties). Imagine a bunch of gizmos that the military wants to coordinate. You might want to model each as a sensor, actuator, and interface. That's a 2-simplex. You might glue interfaces and maybe constrain actuators. Now you're making a simplicial set. There might be some function over local groups of gizmos. Now you have a local section in a sheaf. You might want to engineer a behavior under an ensemble of environmental conditions. Now you're doing statistical physics. Finally you might want to assemble subsystems or groups into systems or teams, or you might want to fuse data or compose various protocols. Now you're doing CT.</p>

<p>I'll quote from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1</a>: "operadic formulations or realizations of data structures for multirobot systems such as the one sketched here are especially desirable because they hold the promise of engineering distinct functionalities in a coherent way. For example, detailed missions can be encoded using flowgraphs [19], constraints can be encoded using weighted maximum satisfiability and/or linear temporal logic formulas, teams can be encoded using simplicial sets [17], etc., and each of these data structures has an associated notion of operad."</p>

<p><em>On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me. “And we were, like, ‘Oh, dear, this is not good.’ ” Musk told Kahl that the vivid illustration of how technology he had designed for peaceful ends was being used to wage war gave him pause.</em></p>
<p>I would guess that quite a few of Starlink's developers were distressed by the prospects of <em>not</em> using it to wage war. Certainly I would have been distressed in such a position.</p>

<p><em>Musk’s sympathies appeared to be manifesting on the battlefield. One day, Ukrainian forces advancing into contested areas in the south found themselves suddenly unable to communicate. “We were very close to the front line,” Mykola, the signal-corps soldier, told me. “We crossed this border and the Starlink stopped working.” The consequences were immediate. “Communications became dead, units were isolated. When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. American and Ukrainian officials told me they believed that SpaceX had cut the connectivity via geofencing, cordoning off areas of access.</em></p>

<p>FWIW your first link contains the passage <em>Reason, by itself, can lay out a road map to peace or to war, to tolerance or to persecution, depending on what the reasoner wants.</em> While some might argue for nonviolence no matter what, I have a hard time imagining Jesus Christ himself doing that instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">flipping over tables and whipping folks</a> when circumstances warranted.</p>

<p>My intent is not to reinvigorate a debate, just to say that historically a VAST number of technologies funded by governments (not just USA and not just DOD funding elements) have been what is often called "dual use". This isn't unique to applications of category theory or math by any means. The discussed CASCADE program is a good example, since the dual use is search and rescue (SAR) but also <em>combat</em> search and rescue (CSAR). Dual use is often merely a change in application context and so very little if anything can be done in practice to avoid contributing to the crossover by those who might be concerned. </p>
<p>Yes, I would say mosaic is the quintessential <em>compositional</em> force package design concept... so very relevant. For better or worse, there are a ton of possible applications of CT to military theory, doctrine, and practice. For instance, I think some of the constructions in categorical systems theory and cybernetics could be extended to model a more general theory of interacting adversarial systems. Another dual use arises: military (obviously) and competing firms within a marketplace. Not to mention applications to model a more general competition between national power structures (ideas like DIMEFIL) in which a military plays only a marginal (though most visible) role.</p>

<p>If they want to eliminate a precise leader who appears to live in the same building than you, you prefer that they send special forces to captur him rather than destroying the whole building and kill lot of people. It's the way Ben Laden was captured as long as I understand. That's the kind of operations that the US or european countries know how to do, using lot of work on getting information and highly-trained soldiers with high-tech equipment. Compare this to Russia sending their soldiers to certain death by using low-tech "human wave attacks" in Ukrainia. I would prefer being an afghan guy, the US operating in my country, rather than an Ukrainian guy, Russia operating in my country. If they don't even care about the life of their people, they will care  even less about my life.</p>

<p>I recently realized that Zulip allows for muting of threads, which means off-topic (wrt actual category theory math) discussions aren't forced on the larger group. This makes it much easier for me to consider engaging here and there in the fringe threads. That is neither here nor there, just felt like stating it.</p>
<p>I will see if I can briefly offer a satisfactory response through the lens of nuclear deterrence terminology. There is a notion of countervalue and counterforce operations in nuclear deployment. There is no reason the terms can't extend to conventional munition deployment. </p>
<p>In counterforce, strikes are limited to military targets. In countervalue, civilian populace and infrastructure are targeted. One goal of counterforce is to intentionally limit civilian impacts (as strange as it may sound given the nuclear context!). The US broadly applies this counterforce idea... with many, <em>many</em> mistakes no doubt, but generally tries. It's part of the legal framework of US armed conflict: LOAC. [Edit: I should say clearly this has not always been the case in the US, especially with respect to nuclear weapons. Also, I mention US in particular only because that's where I am]</p>
<p>If I imagine myself to be a civilian in a nation under military action by a force practicing counterforce methods, I would want their targeting methods and munitions to be as precise as possible, limiting collateral effects and thus minimizing risk to me, who may not care one bit about the grand geo-political machinations surrounding the conflict. I think this is getting at what the OP was saying. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if I am a civilian in a country subject to attack from a countervalue-oriented nation, I would very much like for their military to have highly ineffective weapons so they are less likely to work on me. </p>
<p>Of course nothing is so simple, and everyone knows these ideas, so often military targets are intentionally placed within civilian areas (even by the "good guys"), like a "human shield" ploy, leading to difficulty in executing a purely counterforce operation. But one can still imagine the "ideal" scenario, as silly as it may seem to consider idealism in war. I would just say that nations vie for interests, and it's hard to avoid conflict in all cases, so one should hope that those responsible for carrying it out study and understand it as formally as possible.</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>I never understand this argument. Think from the perspective of a person in a territory being attacked by an imperial military force. Why would you want their weapons to be more effective?</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't answer the question. If I'm attacked by an imperial military force... Hmm... Again I prefer that they kill or capture all the military of my country and not me. Or better, that they destroy all the military equipment of the army of my country, without killing anybody, or something like this, precise and effective, which I'm sure will not kill me, my family and my friends.</p>

<p>Something good will be for example that they take the control of the energy sources, like fuel and electricity, or that they make all electronical devices innefective by making explode a nuclear bomb very high in the sky (I heard that this thing can make all printed circuit boards innefective? ) or that they hack the internet and the bank system of my country...

<p>Sorry, it was still not the question. Making weapons more effective is just a small part of how you can use category theory for instance in the army.

<p>The context was some colleagues was talking about the revoking security clearance scene after watching Oppenheimer with comparison with our cultural revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The imagination of US people is indeed limited.<br>
Revoking some security clearance and expulsion from the project to a well-known university are enough to make the entire academic community mad?<br>
With the security clearance there is even an inspection committee, and Oppenheimer even has an attorney?<br>
The attorney argued these procedures are not legal, not a fair fight, like being beaten up, with injustice?<br>
And the committee even has a two-to-one passage; one of them even wrote a petition of dissent?<br>
Really, don't even talk about McCarthyism to us; your McCarthyism in our country is just child game.</p>

<p>I have noticed a common thread in my adversarial interlocutors' reasoning wherein "the people" either do not have or ought not to have agency. In democracies the former is patently false, and the latter smells to me of sympathy for authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Living in what's considered a democratic state, I certainly feel my agency is pretty thin when it comes to military decisionmaking both in peacetime (assets to build) and in wartime (both when to have it happen and the doctrines to conduct it under).  This is not <em>unique</em> to the military, but rather common to many "special interests".  However, it's especially bad because of both the heavy consequences of those decisions and the heavy level of investment of those "special interests".</p>

<p>I also feel like while defensive wars like the current war (mostly) in the Ukraine are sometimes necessary, arms races between major powers only make these wars harder and make the defense of small states more dependent on major powers.  Those of us who are living in places where we are (mostly) free to develop and express our intellectual creativity as we choose shouldn't lend it to authoritarian powers by developing new kinds of weapons systems in peacetime that those authoritarian states can then copy or steal.</p>

<p>I feel that the efficacy of various democracies is off-topic, but it's certainly the case that individual agency is by design limited in a democracy (unless you happen to agree with the elected representatives on every policy).

<p>By <em>constantly</em> developing new weapons systems, the US maintains an advantage over its adversaries in direct combat situations while at the same time making other democracies more dependent on the US for their defense and making it easier for authoritarian countries to suppress their own populations.  The advantage in actual weapons systems never lasts and constantly needs to be renewed because of reverse engineering and espionage.  The advantage in reserve creativity that underlies it never goes away because it's structural, but the US is constantly turning the global treadmill and using this capacity for aggressive force projection rather than strictly defense.</p>

<p>Yes, the Ukrainians developed the Hrim but they didn't invent short-range ballistic missiles, they developed the Neptune but they didn't invent anti-ship missiles.  I haven't confirmed they didn't invent a <em>category</em> of combat drones but they probably didn't and they didn't develop the drones.  There's plenty of creativity that goes into the operational details of a copy of a weapon system--differences in guidance and propulsion systems, in armor design when applicable, in setting up the most effective payload, but you're missing the forest for the trees.

<p>Ukraine got to its 1991 position as part of the Soviet Union, not as an independent power.  And actively rolling back existing capability, <em>especially</em> nuclear, is not something I support in most circumstances.  The military work I mostly oppose is the <em>most creative</em> work, inventing whole new categories of weapons, new combat doctrines, fundamental new capabilities in sensors and communication, etc.  You need not fear for the <em>existence</em> of your military-industrial complex as long as there are authoritarian states to oppose.</p>

<p>As to whether the world would be safer if the US refrained from these activities: I'm pretty sure thermonuclear weapons (the H-bomb) weren't invented truly independently by anyone other than the US; the US invented them in peacetime and they were stolen by the Soviets.  The existence of combat drones makes the world less safe by making both asymmetric warfare and fundamental democratic control over the military less effective and any period of time they could have been delayed by would have been welcome.  Fully unmanned weapons platforms currently under development take this even farther.</p>

<p>I actually agree with everything you just said except the idea that it's somehow wise to stifle creativity. Because other folks won't. That is the true arms race. As mathematicians we are all part of it. We can dodge it for a time, like Leray in his POW camp developing sheaves instead of PDE methods, but the day may come when those sheaves are eventually used for something. And it will probably end up touching warfighting. Necessity is the mother of invention and nothing says necessity like someone threatening you or those you protect.</p>

<p>Drones and unmanned weapons platforms have been and are a particularly dangerous game, allowing the substitution of industrial capacity for the capacity to replace trained soldiers, forcing a state or area that's being invaded to have to carry out a reverse invasion to deplete the aggressor's capacity to make war.

<p>I think the thing you've been doing with Tom Leinster's work is particularly the sort of thing people in the US shouldn't be doing.  The fact that the Chinese are investing much more heavily in technological espionage than we are is the best evidence that we are doing something wrong here.  We are accelerating military technology ahead of having any good pro-democracy political technologies to deploy in concert with it.  We're not going to make China disappear as a military power, and nor is China going to invade us anytime soon.  They may well invade Taiwan, believing we won't have the stomach to help defend a country we can't even bring ourselves to officially acknowledge, using the technologies they've stolen from us, and hoping to go on to steal the technologies like chip fabs we've exported to Taiwan on top of getting back their oh-so-precious territorial integrity.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to claim everything you've ever done wrt military applications is bad; I think it can even be acceptable sometimes to accept military funding for mathematical work if it's fundamental enough and particularly if you would otherwise accept other funding and do the exact same thing.  But I think it's legitimate to not let military funding draw you into doing work with a direct military application or a dual-use component that you might not otherwise do; <em>especially</em> if you don't understand the scope of the military applications involved; you might even want to let it steer you away.  And if even more people did this, we would have a safer world.  Nobody's saying you can prevent all military use of the work you do, much less the fundamental principles behind it; you can make it incrementally harder and more expensive though, and this is just as legitimate and respectable as engaging in protests.  Maybe it's more so, as methods of elite control in democracies have evolved substantially in the past decades to neutralize the power of protests, but we haven't (yet) developed a means of getting work done without any workers.</p>

<p>But definitely models like this are useful to help in evaluating a decisionmaking mechanism on desiderata like "will people feel the decision is legitimate even if it goes against their private preference" and "does it reliably make use of people's private knowledge or does it degenerate to being controllable by coalitions".  Part of having a good decisionmaking mechanism is it has to exert some influence over people's preferences but not too <em>much</em>.  But it has to be <em>some</em> both to reduce long-term conflict/polarization and to protect participants against outside influence from more hostile social processes that <em>do</em> affect their preferences.</p>

<p>I disagree that they are "basically solved" (and the weaknesses of opinion diffusion on social networks as a decision mechanism, while they include outside controllability, are hardly limited to that!)  Also if the non-controllability of the social network needs outside enforcement from a compliant sovereign regime it doesn't truly exist.  In order to "win" democratic decision making has to be effective at winning internal competitions against the alternatives, not just external ones where it's supported by a sovereign.  For one thing no sovereign in existence would choose to support it, including democratic ones.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental technical challenges of an effective democratic decision mechanism is asymmetric information; often special interests have significantly more information about the subjects of their shared interest than the average member of the general population.  How can we make use of that information, giving the people (whether within the self-interested group or outside) who gather that information fair compensation for doing so, without giving the special interests too much and letting them walk all over everyone else?  Direct democracy as usually implemented tends to lose hold of the information, while representative democracy (through lobbying) overrewards it substantially.  Markets have their own interesting failure mode ("lemon markets") for this kind of asymmetric information problem.  Why aren't you using sheaves to work on this?</p>

<p>Honestly not sure. Counterfactuals are hard (eg, how long until it gets invented anyway? does Cold War turn hot? what happens with Japan, not least if the Soviets claim a zone?) and nuclear power is a net plus on its own merits.</p>
<p>This is the only case of tech development that I can think of that gives me pause. </p>
<p>Dunk on me for not saying “no” outright if you like. But I think the idea that nukes never get developed without the Manhattan Project is far fetched at best and I choose not to interpret your question in what I think is an absurd way.</p>

<p>It's an interesting question whether "the majority of research in the US" is funded by the DoD.   </p>
<p>Total US medical and health research and development investment was $245.1 billion in 2020 - I picked that area because it's big.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the DoD 2024 budget request once again includes a record investment in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of $145 billion.</p>
<p>But that's what I was able to look up in one minute, and both those figures leave out a lot.   In  2023, the  DoD had a total budget of $2.04 trillion, which is pretty amazing.  Global investment in the low-carbon energy transition was only $1.1 trillion in 2022!</p>

<p>Very good point. Imagine what we could do if we invested that 2.04 trillion of taxpayer money in the low-carbon energy transition.</p>

<p>I think maybe you meant the majority of math research? I would guess it's probably also true for computer science and physics and maybe a dozen other fields.</p>

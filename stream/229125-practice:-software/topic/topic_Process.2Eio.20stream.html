<p>Hi all! It was suggested I announce the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="267137" href="/#narrow/stream/267137-process-io">#process-io</a> stream here. It is a channel I created where users of the (currently still private) beta can ask questions. Feel free to lurk, I'll post occasional updates and we should be opening invites at some point. The <a href="https://process.io">https://process.io</a> platform builds on top of <a href="https://statebox.org">https://statebox.org</a> probably familiar to most of you. In short, it will allow you to write software that is structured diagrammatically, using petri nets, monoidal categories and a whole bunch of more stuff.</p>

<p>Anyone have recommendations for software (like say Prover9) that might let me experiment with for conjectures in category theory?  More precisely, say I have a conjecture about equality of some morphisms in a new kind of category (ex: with a couple of monoidal structures, an involution, a couple more gadgets), and fiddling on paper leads nowhere. I'd like to throw this at an automated tool, just to see.</p>
<p>Most automated provers are untyped, which makes reasoning about morphisms hell (partiality is not fun, especially when you know for a fact that it's all total). Advice?</p>
<p>I've been thinking of seeing if something like one of Isabelle's sledgehammers might help. At least that would mostly hide the lack of types from me. But I find encoding category theory in HOL tedious, compared with doing it in dependent type theory, so I'm a little loath to pursue that route. [Plus I can only read Isabelle/HOL right now, I've never written any!]</p>

<p>Have you seen the work of Hamana on SOL (one paper with several examples is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/how-to-prove-decidability-of-equational-theories-with-secondorder-computation-analyser-sol/82CDDB6C015422563D5043CFABC677BC">this one</a>)? I've not yet tried it myself, but it seems pretty powerful.</p>

<p>I had not! Thanks, that does look intriguing.</p>

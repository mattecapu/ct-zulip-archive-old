<p>I have been having fun learning the basics by implementing exercise proofs from the recent Programming with Categories course in Idris and packaging them up as submissions to the statebox idris-ct project. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/statebox/idris-ct/pull/80/files" title="https://github.com/statebox/idris-ct/pull/80/files">most recent, proving CoProducts, Products, and Terminial/Initial Objects are Isomorphic</a>. The similarity of these proofs has me wondering what a nice generalization would look like: a description of a universal property using the universal morphism definition? moving to the context of comma categories?</p>

<p>Products and terminal objects are examples of limits, while coproducts and initial objects are examples of colimits. You could try giving the uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism proof for arbitrary limits or colimits. I'm not an Idris programmer, so I have no idea what that would look like in Idris.</p>

<p>It looks like I might be able to prove that they are all examples of initial objects in a comma category or its dual, and then prove that initial objects in a comma category (or the dual of one) are isomorphic</p>

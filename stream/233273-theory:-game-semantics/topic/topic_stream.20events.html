<p>The 2018 book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91149-6" title="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-91149-6">Immanent Reasoning or Equality in Action</a> gives a very clearly worked out game semantics for Constructive Type Theory with dependent types, which requires thinking of two players one putting forward a thesis and the other trying to disprove it. It would be very interesting to develop this to HoTT. It would also be really interesting to find something that develops the material proofs side more.</p>

<p>Questions for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281250">@Paul-André Melliès</span> after his talk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your slide of typing rules for simple lambda calculus had two colors—what do they mean?</li>
<li>in your ordering of negations as a strategy—shouldn't one player's strategy be independent from the other? how can you know the order that the other will choose? Or does the diagram work despite that? There's something I'm missing. Where can I learn more about those 3d string diagrams in the context of game semantics?</li>
</ol>

<p>or do your diagrams correspond to "one play of the game" vs whether the proponent has a winning strategy?</p>

<p>Also, a question I have: does game semantics somehow generalize both Curry-Howard isomorphism (from proofs, propositions to terms, types) and the Russell-Whitehead isomorphism (from traces, terms to proofs, terms) ?</p>

<p>in the scheduling diagram, it was not initially obvious that (1) the tuples of +/- in your commutative diagram were vertical in the string diagram. And then, it was not clear what the two colors meant.</p>

<p>Also, my zoom was cut while you were explaining the "key observation", so now I don't have the key :-(</p>

<p>What left me hungry in your talk: I have sufficient understanding of game semantics and linear logic, but insufficient understanding of category theory, and there are a lot of things that were more suggestive than explanatory for me, lacking this background.</p>

<p>Your describing functors at "dimension 0, 1, 2" looked very promiseful, but I don't understand how to give it a formal meaning (it doesn't help that I got bounced on and off of zoom)</p>

<p>finally, your presentation mentions <em>differential</em> linear logic, but I completely missed the "differential" part.</p>

<p>Are your slides online? Do you have URLs to the papers you recommend to read and/or to even more elementary papers to read about all these topics? Especially from the point of view of someone passably familiar with games but not with category theory.</p>

<p>The summarizing of things into dimension 0 look particularly interesting, but it's not clear how you determine which positions are "accepted" or not in which operator.</p>

<p>Is there any good reference to unify game theory/decision theory with theoretical computer science? I looked at this book that draws connection between expressing game properties with program verification and model checking, but I wonder if there's a better reference that discusses this problem. <br>

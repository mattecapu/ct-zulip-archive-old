<p>Begin with the following:</p>
<p>a) (X, x ∈ X) is pointed sets, fibered over Set by first projection.<br>
b) (X, S ⊆ X) is propositions on sets, fibered over Set by first projection.</p>
<p>Now, consider the category given by objects (X, L ⊆ P(X)), for some class of Ls. Morphisms are given by set functions f which act pulling back sets in L' to sets in L given as their preimage in f.</p>
<p>My question is: under what conditions is (X, L ⊆ P(X)), "pre-covers on sets" fibered over Set by first projection?</p>
<p>By conditions, I'm thinking along the lines of: "L is closed under intersection" or "L, when viewed as a partially ordered set by inclusion is a distributive lattice" or simply "L contains the empty and maximal sets", etc.</p>

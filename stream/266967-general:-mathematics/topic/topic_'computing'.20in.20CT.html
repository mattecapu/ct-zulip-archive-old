<p>The idea that 'computing' is in quotes in the thread title is another indication of this--computing is seen as something uncommon enough to be described in such a way. By comparison computations of logical objectives were familiar to Aristotle.</p>

<p>Hm. So if the question were changed to: find the number of natural transformations, that would count? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on this, I see that you were under the impression that I a) thought CT-ists didn't actually compute and that b) your set of natural transformations gizmo didn't count as a computation. I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only "in" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called "using" CT than "in" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo "in" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>

<p>Since you brought up enumerative combinatorics, I'll say that a lot of time-tested ways to calculate numbers of structures -- bijective proofs -- typically involve proving two functors are isomorphic (Joyal species). I would call computing the number of structures of one type by bijecting them with another easy-to-count type of structure just that, a computation. Examples from q-mathematics pop to mind.</p>

<p>This is what I'd call "using" CT not "in" CT. The computational objective is more combinatorial than categorical.</p>

<p>But (again please correct me) Yoneda seems more commonly used to characterize things than to compute as part of an algorithm. Now I know we aren't gonna be able to define that because as Yanofsky showed any meaningful notion of algorithm has an undecidable equality predicate, but like Potter Stewart I know an algorithm when I see one.</p>

<p>For anyone interested, our latest thinking about how to implement kan extensions rapidly using existing "chase" algorithms already developed in computer science is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02425">https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02425</a> .  There are enough applications of this to automated reasoning that we were able to publish in the journal of automated reasoning itself, not in a category theory journal.  I think that is another under appreciated point - I'm not convinced applied category theory results are of interest to domain experts, unless they are published in domain-specific journals, rather than math ones.</p>

<p>It's no problem, and I'd be glad to be move on from the nomenclatural debate, now that I see better what you're after. (And I appreciate your efforts to clarify; I'm going to read what you wrote a few more times to be absolutely sure.)

<p>Not sure it wasn't aggressive--I am an aggressive interlocutor in person and online--but it wasn't intended to be <em>very</em> aggressive. </p>
<p>Indeed except for the Kan stuff, which I didn't think of previously, I'm still not sure I've spotted another class of computations, and I suspect the generality of Kan things might even subsume vast swathes of algorithms/computations that aren't generally thought of in that idiom. </p>
<p>Regarding Yoneda, I've used Cayley's theorem (hence Yoneda) in service of explicit computations such as <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/391977/1847">this</a> but don't think of that as _part_ of the computation.</p>

<p>The point I was making was about terminology.  Everyone in the world (at least, everyone who does it) talks about "computing" a homology group when they do, for instance, spectral sequence calculations, which are not (at least, not a priori) reducible to first characterizing something in "numerical" terms and then running an algorithm.  So I was saying that this use of "computing" (which, again, is utterly standard in the field of algebraic topology, not category theory) doesn't fit in your (in my view, overly narrow) meaning of "computation".</p>

Everyone in the world (at least, everyone who does it) talks about "computing" a homology group when they do, for instance, spectral sequence calculations, which are not (at least, not a priori) reducible to first characterizing something in "numerical" terms and then running an algorithm.  So I was saying that this use of "computing" (which, again, is utterly standard in the field of algebraic topology, not category theory) doesn't fit in your (in my view, overly narrow) meaning of "computation".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Whenever I computed something I've been able to look back and seen how in principle it could have been done on a computer, and usually in practice I actually try to prove things by writing code in a poor man's Curry-Howard mindset and writing things up in natural language afterwards. </p>
<p>Often I thought (and think) of my work as a composition of preparatory work ("characterization") with a "mechanical process" a la Turing ("computation"). I need to do the former but in principle only to understand the latter because it can be outsourced to silicon (even though paper is often faster and more useful in practice). My impression has been (and apart from the Kan extension algorithm stuff still is) that CT is more focused on characterization than <em>any other field</em> of mathematics and that this is its nature and intent. A lot of the time (maybe every time?) mathematicians say "is just" they are channeling this, but they are not computing.</p>
<p>BTW can you comment on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338">https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338</a>? I get that it doesn't compute everything.</p>

<p>Right and I think that CT folks generally do less algorithmic stuff (when wearing the CT hat) than other folks. Maybe this is broadly unfair/inaccurate (certainly doesn't fit Ryan W!) but it's not an indictment to begin with.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what people in CT compute, from an example I saw yesterday, I think: given that some object exists by some universal property (it was an exponential in some (2-)category, in what I saw), what actually <strong>is</strong> that object? In the sense of being able to say concretely what the elements are (if this were a concrete category) or what the objects are (if this was an exponential in some 2-category of structured categories, asy), and in a way whose definition is independent of the characterisation by that universal property. Even better if you can give a concrete isomorphism to a priori known and understood object/categories whose objects are a priori known.</p>
<p>Perhaps this falls under the banner of "computing Kan extensions", but this way of looking at it unpacks the actual output of the computation (what even does it mean to "compute a Kan extension" anyway?).</p>
<p>The computation process often involves chaining together known CT theorems, other "calculated" universal objects (i.e. they have a concrete description, but have been shown to satisfy a universal property) and taking advantage of their abstract CT properties and/or some concrete fact to arrive at some concrete description of what the universal object of interest is.</p>
<p>I'm put in mind of the whole Schur functor story that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> and collaborator(s) have worked out.

<p>There's also another sense of of computing, which matters a lot to me.  To me it means working in a situation where I know a bunch of rules for manipulating symbols and I'm applying these rules to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prove two expressions are equal,</li>
<li>reduce an expression to some sort of desired form,  the details of which I don't know ahead of time,</li>
<li>find patterns that may lead to theorems,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is often a lot of exploration and blundering around, not only because I make actual errors but also because I don't know which rule to apply when - and there may also be missing rules that I discover I need, and have to prove.  I have a personal feeling for when I'm "computing" something in this sense, and it's different than "proving" someting, though it may be used to prove something.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of computing - in this sense - to prove Lemma 15 on Kaehler differentials <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/08/grothendieckgaloisbrauer_theor_2.html">here</a>.  By the final writeup there was not much computing left, and I pushed it into Lemma 16.  But this is the distilled result of a lot of blundering about, which was at times rather frustrating since Lemma 15 has a superficially much more elegant proof <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_differential#Definition_using_the_augmentation_ideal">on Wikipedia</a>.  However, on Wikipedia all the "computation" is packed into the last sentence: </p>

<p>Maybe whether or not something is computation has to do with whether it is done on paper vs on a computer, rather than about what is being computed.  Like, sure, I can compute Kan extensions by hand, but not on terabytes of data - I need a computer for that.  Or sure, I can write a proof by hand, but sometimes need an automated theorem prover to solve the word problem for some category presentation for me, because I need to prove millions of expressions equal or not.  Although they are the same activity, the way they are engineered into existence is a lot different</p>

<p>It always annoys me when people try to defend human mathematicians vs. computers which would remplace them. Because making mathematics understanble by computers is equal to making mathematics better, both for humans and computers. I know an example where such a thing happened. There is a field in algebraic topology which is named Functor calculus, or Goodwillie calculus. It is named calculus because it looks like calculus but it is clearly not the same thing. Investigation in computer science led to linear logic, twenty years later, differential linear logic was invented, then differential categories, then cartesian differential categories and then in 2018, in this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01930">Directional derivatives and higher order chain rules for abelian functor calculus</a> they found that functor calculus gives an example of cartesian differential category.</p>
<p>So, here progress in pure mathematics came from research in logic and an aera of logic which is tightely linked with the theory of programming languages. So, please, yes people were doing computations before computers exist, but what computers are doing is closer to what computation is really: a completely mechanical process. So it is the computers which are really doing computations. And helping them to do these computations, is a good thing for everybody. Being against the mechanization of mathematics is being against progress in mathematics.</p>

<p>There is often a lot of exploration and blundering around, not only because I make actual errors but also because I don't know which rule to apply when - and there may also be missing rules that I discover I need, and have to prove. </p>

<p>I think that for you computing is thus the manipulation of formal rules, once you have specified what are the rules of the game ie. you have chosen the axioms and then you want to manipulate them to try proving something.</p>
<p>A stronger form a computation would be to have an algorithm which when you give him what you want to prove, give you a proof, ie. a way to apply the rules of the game to prove what you want to prove.</p>

<p>I think in mathematics you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>work in a precise context and try to find a proof of something, this is what I was talking about </li>
<li>define new structures, ie. set of axioms, for instance finding a new version of what is a space: either a topological space, a local, a frame etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>This second activity is very difficult to formalize and it is difficult to link it to any kind of computation.</p>

<p>Honnestly, I'm very far from understanding what is computation. I find it very intriguing that category theory seems more related to computation than set theory -- I say that because of all the work in computer science which uses category theory, whereas at the same time it looks also more abstract, and thus makes you think that you're not going to produce an algorithm with some pratical application from it.</p>

<p>To elaborate on what Mike is saying, one of the failure modes for programmers working in proof assistants is to try to "game" the proof assistant and produce a proof without understanding why it is true.  Even with automation, this doesn't work well - we teach that it is a sign to do more math and less programming.  So I absolutely agree that proof search in the sense of logic programming or automated theorem moving is usually at a lower level of abstraction that what mathematicians are doing in practice.  I don't expect machines to replace mathematicians, but I would like mathematicians to get as much as possible out of machines.   I think there's a lot computers have to offer mathematicians, but the best is yet to come- it will no doubt go beyond proof search</p>

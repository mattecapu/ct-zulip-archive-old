<p>The idea that 'computing' is in quotes in the thread title is another indication of this--computing is seen as something uncommon enough to be described in such a way. By comparison computations of logical objectives were familiar to Aristotle.</p>

<p>Hm. So if the question were changed to: find the number of natural transformations, that would count? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on this, I see that you were under the impression that I a) thought CT-ists didn't actually compute and that b) your set of natural transformations gizmo didn't count as a computation. I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only "in" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called "using" CT than "in" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo "in" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>

<p>Since you brought up enumerative combinatorics, I'll say that a lot of time-tested ways to calculate numbers of structures -- bijective proofs -- typically involve proving two functors are isomorphic (Joyal species). I would call computing the number of structures of one type by bijecting them with another easy-to-count type of structure just that, a computation. Examples from q-mathematics pop to mind.</p>

<p>This is what I'd call "using" CT not "in" CT. The computational objective is more combinatorial than categorical.</p>

<p>But (again please correct me) Yoneda seems more commonly used to characterize things than to compute as part of an algorithm. Now I know we aren't gonna be able to define that because as Yanofsky showed any meaningful notion of algorithm has an undecidable equality predicate, but like Potter Stewart I know an algorithm when I see one.</p>

<p>For anyone interested, our latest thinking about how to implement kan extensions rapidly using existing "chase" algorithms already developed in computer science is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02425">https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02425</a> .  There are enough applications of this to automated reasoning that we were able to publish in the journal of automated reasoning itself, not in a category theory journal.  I think that is another under appreciated point - I'm not convinced applied category theory results are of interest to domain experts, unless they are published in domain-specific journals, rather than math ones.</p>

<p>It's no problem, and I'd be glad to be move on from the nomenclatural debate, now that I see better what you're after. (And I appreciate your efforts to clarify; I'm going to read what you wrote a few more times to be absolutely sure.)

<p>Not sure it wasn't aggressive--I am an aggressive interlocutor in person and online--but it wasn't intended to be <em>very</em> aggressive. </p>
<p>Indeed except for the Kan stuff, which I didn't think of previously, I'm still not sure I've spotted another class of computations, and I suspect the generality of Kan things might even subsume vast swathes of algorithms/computations that aren't generally thought of in that idiom. </p>
<p>Regarding Yoneda, I've used Cayley's theorem (hence Yoneda) in service of explicit computations such as <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/391977/1847">this</a> but don't think of that as _part_ of the computation.</p>

<p>The point I was making was about terminology.  Everyone in the world (at least, everyone who does it) talks about "computing" a homology group when they do, for instance, spectral sequence calculations, which are not (at least, not a priori) reducible to first characterizing something in "numerical" terms and then running an algorithm.  So I was saying that this use of "computing" (which, again, is utterly standard in the field of algebraic topology, not category theory) doesn't fit in your (in my view, overly narrow) meaning of "computation".</p>

Everyone in the world (at least, everyone who does it) talks about "computing" a homology group when they do, for instance, spectral sequence calculations, which are not (at least, not a priori) reducible to first characterizing something in "numerical" terms and then running an algorithm.  So I was saying that this use of "computing" (which, again, is utterly standard in the field of algebraic topology, not category theory) doesn't fit in your (in my view, overly narrow) meaning of "computation".</p>

<p>Fair enough. Whenever I computed something I've been able to look back and seen how in principle it could have been done on a computer, and usually in practice I actually try to prove things by writing code in a poor man's Curry-Howard mindset and writing things up in natural language afterwards. </p>
<p>Often I thought (and think) of my work as a composition of preparatory work ("characterization") with a "mechanical process" a la Turing ("computation"). I need to do the former but in principle only to understand the latter because it can be outsourced to silicon (even though paper is often faster and more useful in practice). My impression has been (and apart from the Kan extension algorithm stuff still is) that CT is more focused on characterization than <em>any other field</em> of mathematics and that this is its nature and intent. A lot of the time (maybe every time?) mathematicians say "is just" they are channeling this, but they are not computing.</p>
<p>BTW can you comment on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338">https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338</a>? I get that it doesn't compute everything.</p>

<p>I didn't mean there <em>aren't</em> algorithms, just that what mathematicians do isn't <em>a priori</em> just running an algorithm.</p>

<p>Right and I think that CT folks generally do less algorithmic stuff (when wearing the CT hat) than other folks. Maybe this is broadly unfair/inaccurate (certainly doesn't fit Ryan W!) but it's not an indictment to begin with.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced of that, but I agree it's not an indictment.  If it has any moral value, I would say it would be a good thing, as it would mean we're less likely to be replaced by computers.  (-:  I'm glad we reached the actual point eventually, even if we have to agree to disagree about terminology.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what people in CT compute, from an example I saw yesterday, I think: given that some object exists by some universal property (it was an exponential in some (2-)category, in what I saw), what actually <strong>is</strong> that object? In the sense of being able to say concretely what the elements are (if this were a concrete category) or what the objects are (if this was an exponential in some 2-category of structured categories, asy), and in a way whose definition is independent of the characterisation by that universal property. Even better if you can give a concrete isomorphism to a priori known and understood object/categories whose objects are a priori known.</p>
<p>Perhaps this falls under the banner of "computing Kan extensions", but this way of looking at it unpacks the actual output of the computation (what even does it mean to "compute a Kan extension" anyway?).</p>
<p>The computation process often involves chaining together known CT theorems, other "calculated" universal objects (i.e. they have a concrete description, but have been shown to satisfy a universal property) and taking advantage of their abstract CT properties and/or some concrete fact to arrive at some concrete description of what the universal object of interest is.</p>
<p>I'm put in mind of the whole Schur functor story that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> and collaborator(s) have worked out. There's some abstract 2-rig stuff, but it comes down to computing the "solution" to be a specific known thing.</p>

<p>There's also another sense of of computing, which matters a lot to me.  To me it means working in a situation where I know a bunch of rules for manipulating symbols and I'm applying these rules to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prove two expressions are equal,</li>
<li>reduce an expression to some sort of desired form,  the details of which I don't know ahead of time,</li>
<li>find patterns that may lead to theorems,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is often a lot of exploration and blundering around, not only because I make actual errors but also because I don't know which rule to apply when - and there may also be missing rules that I discover I need, and have to prove.  I have a personal feeling for when I'm "computing" something in this sense, and it's different than "proving" someting, though it may be used to prove something.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of computing - in this sense - to prove Lemma 15 on Kaehler differentials <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/08/grothendieckgaloisbrauer_theor_2.html">here</a>.  By the final writeup there was not much computing left, and I pushed it into Lemma 16.  But this is the distilled result of a lot of blundering about, which was at times rather frustrating since Lemma 15 has a superficially much more elegant proof <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_differential#Definition_using_the_augmentation_ideal">on Wikipedia</a>.  However, on Wikipedia all the "computation" is packed into the last sentence: </p>

<p>I don't feel I did a lot of "computing" in this sense in my part of proving the theorems in the paper on <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/06/schur_functors_and_categorifie.html">Schur functors</a>.  Maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> did.   There is, however, a lot of computing to be done in this subject - the Littlewood-Richardson rules for tensoring Schur functors, and plethysm for composing Schur functors (where no practical algorithm is known even today!).</p>

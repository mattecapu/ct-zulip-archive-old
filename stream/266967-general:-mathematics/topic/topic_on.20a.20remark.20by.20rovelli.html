<p>I've never heard of "diffeomorphism-invariant physics" before, and I find my curiosity piqued. Looking at Wikipedia, I see that a diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of smooth manifolds. In a physics context, what would we be using smooth manifolds for? And why would we want to consider isomorphisms between them?</p>
<p>My first guess would be that we can model regions of space as smooth manifolds, and that some diffeomorphisms might conceivably include rotating/flipping or translating. I think I remember reading that some conservation laws in physics can be arrived at by requiring the equations that govern certain phenomena to have the same solutions even after these transformations are applied (?). I have no idea if this the kind of thing "diffeomorphism-invariant physics" is concerned with though.</p>

<p>Winskel talks about something called <em>event structures</em>, and uses them to model concurrency. In this setting the word "event" has a precise meaning as an element of an event structure. I wouldn't expect any connection to the general topic just because the word "event" is used in both cases, and I suspect that concurrency theory has very little to do with physics (both now and probably in the future, although I'd be happy to be proven wrong).</p>

<p>Or what Sarah Walker called "state-dependency" in her work The Descent of Math that information has causal power: <br>
"An example of why any of this matters may be in order. Consider the set of states of the world corresponding to Earth plus its satellites. This set may be partitioned into two subsets: states where some physical systems have knowledge of Newton’s law5 (i.e., humans) and states where there is no such knowledge6. One example of the latter is Earth with one natural satellite – the Moon, which was the state of Earth in our history prior to 1957. It is entirely possible (and by that I mean allowed by the laws of physics) that Earth might have also had no Moon, two captured asteroids for Moons (as is the case for Mars) or a potential host of alternative smallish rocky bodies orbiting it. All are equally viable states of the world consistent with known physics. It is also entirely possible (again I mean allowed by the laws of physics) that Earth have any number of artificial satellites or space junk. However, the latter set of states, while possible, is not accessible (by this I mean not encoded in the initial conditions) without human or human-­‐like technology. Thus, when comparing the size of the state space of Earth plus satellites, the state space is much larger if artificial satellites are included, i.e., if laws of gravitation are known. Thus when considering the number of states of the world consisting of Earth plus satellites, very many more states are potentially accessible from states of the world in which some physical systems have knowledge of the laws of gravitation than from a node where there is no such information. Thus, in a network of all possible states of the world, nodes with knowledge of Newton’s law are more highly connected to other nodes within the space of all possible configurations of Earth plus satellites."</p>

<p>On the topic of dependence, you might find parts of "Duoidal Structures for Compositional Dependence" (by Shapiro and Spivak) to be of interest. I've only looked at the start of it, but it talks about categories with two ways to combine pairs of objects: one that is used when the two objects model independent events, and one that is used when one event depends on the other. Apparently this relates to something called a "duoidal category".</p>

<p>Thanks for the encouragement. I think because mathematics is now divided into pure and applied, the meaning part is lost, although I think since mathematics concern the highest universality of human practices, the loss of meanings ends up putting up barricades on places where new development can happens. </p>
<p>My understanding now is that Rovelli's saying the world is not made of particles and reversible dynamical laws of the particles, it's made of relations between possible events, and events as some change that happens that may or may not be measured e.g. entanglement, therefore he puts uncertainty principle, irreversibility, non-equilibrium conditions, information loss from measurement at the centre of physics. The relation between events i.e. constraints is where complexity of an organism lies, which allows the organism to circumvent the dynamics causally, while the dynamics can be quite simple e.g. second law of thermodynamics. This is likewise the case of the inconsistency relations that Winkle is talking about, that the relation between uncertain environment and computer program(s), and between program and program(s). Same phenomena happen in complex system works such as Walker e.g. relation between satellites and Barrett  e.g. relation between mental phenomena and physical phenomena. The relations are to be contrasted to functions of certitude and reversibility. Same phenomena happen in philosophy works such as James on pragmatic theory of Truth i.e. it's the value that's evolving towards higher complexity. Likewise in social sciences that has pragmatic orientations, such as those of Parsons.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting point regarding the praxis and the philosophy of mathematics. I strongly agree that the fundamental idea of mathematics is to strip form of substance and focus on that (<em>abstraction</em>), and it can be misleading to read more than a coincidence in a choice of terminology (or in any other recurrent formal pattern). In that sense, 'event' in Winskel's event structures and 'event' in GR are as related as 'x' in an equation and 'x' in another.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the reason Winskel and Einstein used the word 'event', and not some made up string, is to hint to an underlying intuition they would like to evoke. I argue this is at least equally fundamental to mathematics. Abstraction is something all people do and have been doing outside and before mathematics. The difference is mathematicians try to channel their intuitions into more precise language.<br>
These underlying intuitions, producing formal coincidences across mathematics, can often be mined for interesting abstractions. Indeed, I would be very surprised if one couldn't meaningfully connect event structures and 'spacetime causality', even though the connection might not be fertile (one would need more motivation for sure).</p>
<p>As always, the answer lies in the synthesis of these two moments. I argue mathematics is powered by the meaning-form dialectic, and it's misleading to focus on either side only. There is no divide between applied and theoretical mathematics, there is a continuum, and ideas slowly move back and forth like air convecting in a room. So it's important to not mistake the finger for the moon (form for meaning), but it's important also to remember we are looking at the moon because the finger is pointing at it, and the finger is pointing at it because there is something there.</p>

<p>you are right in the sense that i said it quickly and simply and it sounds like wittgenstein and i am definitely no wittgenstein. </p>
<p>what are we doing here, talking to each other, if all these words are just variables? at least <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span>  means <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span>. when wittgenstein said consistency doesn't matter, turing said "but the bridges will fall if theories are inconsistent".</p>
<p>what is the difference between the finger and the moon? on the surface, they are two words. in the context, they are metaphors for some abstractions, which linguists would call signifiant and signifiee. oh, you said form-meaning. i agree. while there is, of course, the well-studied possibility that the moon could be made of cheese (stilton, i believe) it would be a hassle if we all engaged in cartesian meditations worrying how to be sure that the moon is there. so we agree that the moon is there. next thing you know, we also agree that lower taxes mean higher employment, since it really means a lot to me that we agree about that, and it would be hassle to go around disagreeng too much...</p>
<p>it's a hassle to disagree, and it's a hassle to agree. (before the "agreeing to disagree" paper, aumann constructed an example where two players with the same priors deduce from the same observations completely <strong>different</strong> models. he never ever mentioned that model again. he is a deeply religious man.)</p>
<p>exercise: express the relation of the finger and the moon as an adjunction.</p>
<p>PS the correlations are of course dialectical, and lawvere is a true giant, but he could have done even more if he didn't go around talking about dialectics so much, almost to the point of making himself into a sort of a wittgenstein of leninism. (or maoism a couple of years earlier.)</p>

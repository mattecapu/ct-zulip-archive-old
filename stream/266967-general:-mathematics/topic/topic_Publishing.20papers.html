<p>I don't know anything about how publishing works.<br>
I have a small theorem, it took like a month to prove, it is not entirely trivial but not the most interesting thing in the world. I know where I want to go next, I have a bigger theorem lined up which is more interesting.  I have related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>At what point do you cut your work off and say "This is a publishable chunk." When is it appropriate to just put up a small research note that establishes a basic theorem, maybe 5-15 pages, and say "More to come on this later" vs just folding it back into your work and waiting until you have the bigger thing ready</li>
<li>How do you tell the level of significance that distinguishes between "just upload to the arxiv and move on", "maybe a conference paper", "worth publishing in a half-decent journal"</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm afraid I'd have to hear more about the theorem, because different people have completely different ideas about the meaning of "not entirely trivial but not the most interesting thing in the world".    I know good mathematicians who don't bother to publish work that other people would <em>love</em> to publish, and also mathematicians who publish things that other people would find embarrassingly easy.    If you want to tell it to me privately I promise not to steal it or share it with anyone.    For now I can just offer limited advice.</p>

<p>When it is, in fact, publishable.   Different journals have different standards.  To tell if something is publishable in Journal X, you need to look at a bunch of articles in Journal X.     The only shortcut is to have an advisor who knows your work and has read Journal X.   But even if you do have such an advisor, it's good to do this sort of reading yourself, where you look at journals just to see what they're like - not to understand the papers in detail, but just to see what it takes to publish a paper there.</p>

<p>Ok, cool. This is a sensible answer. I will come back to this thread later once I have written up and double-checked the proof, and describe the theorem then. I have been trying to force myself to get more familiar with journals but it's hard.</p>

<p>Ultimately, of course, the only way to really answer the question of whether something is publishable in journal X is to submit it there and find out whether it gets accepted.  Looking at other articles in journal X can give you an idea, but you can get surprised in both directions.  Sometimes the editor and the referee matter.</p>

<p>I do think there's more to deciding when to cut the work off and publish what you've got than only the question of whether you <em>could</em> publish what you've got.  You don't always want to aim for the Minimum Publishable Unit.</p>
<p>My default approach is to work on a subject until I'm done working on it for now, and then figure out how to make zero or more publishable papers out of what I've got.  Depending on the situation, "done working on it for now" might mean that I've proven everything I wanted to prove; or it might mean I've proven <em>something</em> and I wish I could prove more, but I'm out of ideas or time for working on it more right now.  For instance, the latter is how I ended up writing four papers about the semantics of HoTT in higher toposes: each time I came back to it with a new idea and pushed it as far as I could at that time, even though the first three times that wasn't as far as I wanted.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it happens that I'm not done working on a project yet, but I reach a point where I have a pretty good guess that <em>eventually</em> I'll want to split it up into multiple papers, and I can tell that the material that'll go in one of those papers is basically complete.  This is a bit dangerous because writing up and publishing that paper tends to distract me from actually continuing to work on the project, and so it takes longer to finish the other papers (if I indeed ever do).  For instance, my work on LNL polycategories was originally intended to prove a 2-conservativity result for them, but developing the basic theory got so long that I published a paper about just that -- and I still haven't gone back to finish the 2-conservativity.</p>

<p>As for how I would split a project up into papers when it's finished, there are a lot of considerations.  Usually my default approach is to start trying to write it as one paper, and see whether it starts collapsing under its own weight or trying to break itself in half, and if so whether there are parts it could be divided into that can stand on their own.  Another thing to think about is whether different parts of the work are of interest to different communities and might benefit from being published in different venues, or at least unencumbered by other parts of the project that some readers might be intimidated or bored by.</p>
<p>For instance, right now I'm working on a theorem about semantics of modal dependent type theory.  I have a pretty satisfying result about semantics in diagrams of 1-categories, and a less complete result about diagrams of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">âˆž</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">âˆž</span></span></span></span>-categories, and I've been going back and forth about whether to put them in one paper or two.  At the moment, I'm leaning towards publishing the 1-categorical version on its own, because it's more complete, doesn't require homotopy-theoretic background to read, and will probably be of interest to a wider audience.  Then I'd take some more time to see whether I can get a better result in the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">âˆž</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">âˆž</span></span></span></span>-case before deciding to cut off that work and publish it.  But I might change my mind again!</p>

<p>I have a related question. Is it okay to add a substantial amount of work to an already published paper by updating it on the ArXiv without making a new official publication or are people doing this only for minor corrections? It seems simpler to add the news to an already published paper than doing a new one each time and multiplying the number of papers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="428716">@Jean-Baptiste Vienney</span> I would not seriously update a paper on the arXiv that was already published. If it's a substantial amount of work, it can be its own paper. Sometimes perhaps one is in the position Mike was in, but where the paper with the partial results weren't yet submitted, and then with a chunk more work, it turns out a complete story could be told. In that case it might be reasonable to update the arXiv paper, but definitely noting in the metadata that this is the case. The situation where this makes the most sense is where the additional work gives a stronger result, but which on its own seems like an incremental addition (regardless of how much effort went into finding the new resut).</p>
<p>For example, my first solo paper, post-PhD in TAC is different to how it was when I first submitted it, because in the very slow revision processes (I left academia temporarily, and other life stuff happened), I managed to make the results more general. So I updated the arXiv version, and the updated version back to the journal, upon which the referee was I think rather gracious in reading over a heavily-revised article (though the generalisation wouldn't have really been worth a sequel on its own, it just rewrote the main results in a way that was more general). I had to, at one point, cut this revision off, since I was in danger of writing a legitimately new paper, rather than merely strenthening  the existing one.</p>

<p>You can't expect people to reread a paper that has been put on the arXiv after they've read it once, so - especially if you are hoping to eventually get a job - it pays to really finish a paper before putting it on the arXiv, and then if you have a new idea write another paper.</p>

<p>if i understand correctly, the point is that research is a process of understanding things (ie finding ways to interact). publishing comes after some progress has been made in that direction, as means to understand things better together (and perhaps get paid and keep doing it longer...) </p>
<p>if this approximates your point, then i think it is a very important point. mounting the cart of publishing in front of the horse of research is a call for trouble, stress, and <strong>bad deals</strong>. </p>
<p>young people are confronted with a world of impact factors. i think they should be warned that even winning in that game is a bad deal. they signed up to do research, and they end up spending time on writing long versions of short papers and splitting long papers into publishable units, instead of doing research and writing new papers.  </p>
<p>i don't know a way out of there, but there must be since it hampers science and civilization needs science.</p>

<p>I'm going to be be very honest. The point is that I'm already not heavily excited by the idea to get a postdoc later and then maybe accumulating several ones before finally abandoning doing math in academia because I don't find a stable position. Several past or potential relationship have already told me implicitly or explicitly that they changed their mind and don't want to stay with me or simply don't want to start if they don't know where and when I will have a normal job like people outside academia. Anyway I think I should continue because I would probably be really bad in another occupation than doing a phd in math today. But in these conditions it's harder to have the passion to carefully write well-crafted papers that people will enjoy. That's exactly my state of mind today.</p>

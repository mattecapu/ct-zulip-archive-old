<p>Along with Feynman's theory of Feynman diagrams, Penrose's theory of spin networks was one of the big motivations for taking string diagrams seriously in category theory.   A lot of Penrose's  first papers on this subject are hard to get, so I've made them all available here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/penrose/">Penrose on spin networks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just yesterday I found John Mousorris' thesis online, and added it to this page.  He was a student of Penrose who wrote a nice thesis on spin networks.</p>

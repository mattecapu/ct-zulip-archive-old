<p>a while ago I asked on math.stackexchange if there was something like <a href="https://topology.pi-base.org/">pi-base</a> but for categories, where you could search for categories by property, by name, or as counterexamples to theorems (check out how cool pi-base is for this if you haven't seen it already! you can search for things like <a href="https://topology.pi-base.org/theorems/T000112">"T5=&gt;T4?"</a> and see some spaces that are witness to the fact that this isn't true).</p>
<p><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1639034/category-theory-zoo?noredirect=1#comment9872412_1639034">recently, one of the maintainers for pi-base said</a> that if any category theorists are interested in building a version of this for categories, then to reach out. i would love to do this but don't have the time or energy right now, but figured that there would probably be a bunch of people on this forum that would!</p>

<p>I have been developing a network of relationships for geometric morphisms (and hence properties of toposes); I would love to develop that into a pi-base database at some point, but I guess a category pi-base is a prerequisite to that existing <span aria-label="rolling on the floor laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f923" role="img" title="rolling on the floor laughing">:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span></p>

<p>That sounds really useful. I'm not sure if a general category theory pi-base would be a prerequisite. I would say "properties of geometric morphisms of topoi" is a partially independent subject, closer to geometry.</p>

<p>a while ago I asked on math.stackexchange if there was something like <a href="https://topology.pi-base.org/">pi-base</a> but for categories, where you could search for categories by property, by name, or as counterexamples to theorems (check out how cool pi-base is for this if you haven't seen it already! you can search for things like <a href="https://topology.pi-base.org/theorems/T000112">"T5=&gt;T4?"</a> and see some spaces that are witness to the fact that this isn't true).</p>
<p><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1639034/category-theory-zoo?noredirect=1#comment9872412_1639034">recently, one of the maintainers for pi-base said</a> that if any category theorists are interested in building a version of this for categories, then to reach out. i would love to do this but don't have the time or energy right now, but figured that there would probably be a bunch of people on this forum that would!</p>

<p>Can you say a bit more about what you mean by "appear"?  Do you mean how do we construct filtered colimits when working in type theory as a foundation for mathematics?  Basically just like any other colimit, as a non-recursive higher inductive type.  (Although, again like any other colimit, in HoTT there are issues with expressing (homotopy) colimits of arbitrary types (rather than just sets) over infinite diagram categories.)</p>

<p>Ah, right. I think I was hoping that filtered colimits had some kind of interesting type-theoretic characterization rather than being a particular kind of general colimits/non-recursive HIT if that makes sense?</p>

<p>Well, I don't think they do.  Although some of the <em>applications</em> of filtered colimits can be achieved directly with recursive HITs.  Plus filtered colimits are less generally useful in the absence of choice principles, since then there are fewer compact objects.</p>

<p>A category is to a finite limits theory (aka, an <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/essentially+algebraic+theory">essentially algebraic theory</a>) as a 2-category is to... what?</p>
<p>I want to be able to say "essentially algebraic 2-theory," but if I say that, I should know what it actually means.</p>
<p>Here's a more specific question, which might be better posed: if the theory of a 2-category is a finite limits theory, then the theory of a pseudo-category is... what kind of theory?</p>

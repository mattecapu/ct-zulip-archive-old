<p>I've heard recently of a couple of non-degenerate models of (multiplicative) Linear Logic -- that is, *-autonomous categories -- which seem especially natural and simple, and which I'm intrigued by. Namely, these are the category SupLat of suplattices and FinBan of finite Banach spaces and contractions. However, I'm finding it hard to find references to detailed discussions of the *-autonomous structure for these categories. </p>
<p>My question stems partially from trying to build an intuition for the structures discussed in the paper <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/2/24-02.pdf">Frobenius relations meet linear distributivity" by J M Egger</a>. In it, he defines a notion of Frobenius algebra where the co/multiplication are defined with respect to _distinct_ monoidal structures, which interact via linear distributivity. In the abstract, he tantalizingly says:</p>
<p>"For example, when studying Frobenius algebras in the âˆ—-autonomous category Sup, the standard concept using only the usual tensor product is less interesting than a similar one in which both the usual tensor product and its de Morgan dual (par) are used."</p>
<p>but (as far as I can see) does not expand on this example. So, I'm looking for natural models of the structure he defines, starting with the suggested one in SupLat. Now, I could work out the details myself, but I was wondering first if anyone had any relevant references regarding these categories' *-autonomous structure, or any intuitions for the categories mentioned, and might be willing to exposit for me?</p>

<p>There are lots of papers on formalizing category theory in ZFC or NBG set theory, or ZFC+ some number of universes.<br>
There are also lots of papers on formalizing category theory in Coq, Lean or other dependent type theories.</p>
<p>I am interested in what has been done theoretically regarding the possibility of carrying out the development of category theory in HOL, perhaps + extra axioms. HOL is a weaker logic than the calculus of constructions and dependent types are very natural for encoding category theory, so this is arguably an uphill battle, but I think the question is still interesting because automation in HOL leads automation in dependent type theory by a considerable margin at the moment. Reasoning in category theory is often very simple (equational reasoning is often all that is necessary for proving a diagram commutes) and so one would like to be able to take advantage of automation.</p>

<p>There are papers in the Isabelle/HOL archive of formal proofs. i have been reading the papers by Eugene Stark. it is very interesting but honestly his conception of a "category of sets" is utterly foreign to me, I am very taken aback. I am wondering if there has been much other theoretical work on this topic</p>

<p>Which paper has the unexpected definition of the category of sets?  The "Types" mailing list is probably a good place to ask this question.  <a href="https://lists.seas.upenn.edu/mailman/listinfo/types-list">https://lists.seas.upenn.edu/mailman/listinfo/types-list</a></p>

<p>Maybe not exactly what you are asking for, but this describes a development of some category theory in Isabelle/HOL: <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44755-5_11">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44755-5_11</a></p>

<p>Now I'm curious about what an utterly foreign concept of "a category of sets" could look like!</p>

<p>I've come across the concept of "noncommutative geometry", but haven't been able to understand it.</p>
<p>But I know that the internal language of the classifying topos of commutative rings, or of commutative local rings, supports the important axioms of synthetic differential geometry. So does the internal language of the classifying topos of <em>noncommutative</em> local rings support some sort of "synthetic noncommutative geometry"?</p>
<p>If so, is there a paper explaining noncommutative geometry from this perspective?</p>

<p>I have been learning things among type theory, âˆž-category theory and (classical) galois theory. <br>
I have a question now. <br>
Does anyone know there is study for a concrete application of generalized galois theory to type system extension such as extensions of simply typed lambda calculus ?</p>
<p>Edit: <br>
Self resolved: <br>
Model Category might be seen the one with Pi-types whose fibrations act like Galois theory.<br>
And it does not seem popular to apply galois theory to Simply Typed Lambda Caluculus rather than to a modern type system.</p>

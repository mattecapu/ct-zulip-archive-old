<p>I'm starting to learn category learning and I have a couple of questions on books and beyond. Right now I'm in two reading groups, one on "Category Theory for Programmers" and another on "Seven Sketeches in Compositionality".</p>
<ol>
<li>After going through these books is there any new material in "Conceptual Mathematics"? Should I also use it as reference when I don't understand a topic presented on CTfP or Seven Sketches?</li>
<li>After reading those books should I still work through "Algebra: Chapter 0" and math3ma's "Topology: A Categorical Approach"?</li>
<li>If so, which chapters of Munkres should I read before diving in math3ma's book?</li>
<li>After these books how should I continue my (Applied) Category Theory journey/learning ?</li>
</ol>

<p>Uh, there's certainly a lot of overlap among these books. I didn't read any of them from cover to cover though, so I don't know exactly how much. What's sure is that each of them covers CT from a different point of view, and this means that the set of things you'll learn from each of them is different, and even in the intersection the way you're exposed to thing is gonna be different.<br>
For example, monads in Milewski's book are gonna be explained from a CS point of view (effects or inductive data types), which is quite different from monads in algebra (free constructions) and monads in topology (completions, I guess?).<br>
This is a general theme in CT: the core concepts are not numerous, but they are incredibly versatile. So learning is not idempotent anymore.</p>

<p>You can read 'Topology: A Categorical Approach' without reading any Munkres. They're both introductions to point-set topology but with slightly different approaches. 'Algebra: Chapter 0' is a fantastic graduate algebra book so that's a good place to start.</p>

<p>This is a very personal thing, but personally I find that early on picking some research question (even if it turns out to be a <em>bad</em> research question in retrospect) is a much more effective way for me to learn than just reading stuff</p>

<p>Hi!   <em>Conceptual Mathematics</em> is a very distinctive book: it explains Lawvere's philosophy of category theory in a way aimed at beginners.  (Lawvere, you may have heard, had a lot of important ideas in category theory.)  So, no other book will replace that book, but also it's not what I'd call a "reference" - it's more like an adventure of its own.</p>

<p>I'd say that's more than "slightly" more advanced than the other books listed.    It's aimed at people who know about lots of subjects in math, and it draws its examples from those.  But it's a great book to read after those listed if you're into math.</p>

<p>Personally, I can't imagine <em>learning</em> category theory from <em>Conceptual mathematics</em>.  But once you already know what it's talking about, it's an amusing read.  YMMV of course.</p>

<p>I think beginners could learn <em>something</em> from <em>Conceptual Mathematics</em>, but it would be something more like Lawvere's attitude toward math.  (I don't, in fact, know any beginner who succeeded in getting through this book.)</p>

<p>Content-wise, there isn't that much to learn in a first category theory course, but it takes a while to actually internalise the concepts so it helps to relearn the same thing multiple times from different perspectives.</p>

<p>Because I love math and the abstractions of CT look really interesting. Second because I'm working on Deep Learning and I feel like a lot of stuff could benefit at least from categorical inspirations (compositionality is pretty much one of the assumptions of Deep Learning). Finally I feel like compositionality is a powerful idea in general, showing up in things like shell, Lisps. JAX and Julia</p>

<p>If you love math and are interested in category theory in its own right, you should look at something which is about pure category theory.  I really like these notes: <a href="https://home.gwu.edu/~wschmitt/papers/cat.pdf">https://home.gwu.edu/~wschmitt/papers/cat.pdf</a>  After working through these notes, I used Emily Riehl's book, which has a lot of examples from different fields of math --- if you don't know those fields, you won't get all the examples, but you can just skip the examples you don't get.  I've also heard other computer science people say they liked Awodey's book, though I have not looked at it much personally.  "Algebra Chapter 0" and "Topology: A Categorical Approach" would be great if you want to learn algebra and topology, do you want to learn these things?</p>

In computer science I think it is called the 'coinductive list monoid'.<br>
Another well known example is the conatural numbers  (that is the coinductive free monoid on a singleton set) which is the natural numbers + infinity.</p>
<p>In category theory these free structure come from left adjoints to a forgetful functor.<br>
Where do the coinductive free structures come from? Is it actually the right adjoint??</p>
<p>Also, is there any reason why coinductive structures seem to be uncommon in maths since in computer science they seem to be quite important?</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276875">Bruno Gavranovic</span> what do you recommend for someone interested in ACT for Deep Learning?</p>

<p>Hi Joao! Unfortunately ACT for Deep Learning is a relatively niche field, and I'm not sure if there's any introductory texts focused on understanding CT with examples from Deep learning. <br>
If what you're looking for is papers, then you're sort of in luck, because there's a few. I compiled a list a while ago <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning">https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning</a>  but most of these are probably pretty abstract if you're just getting into this. Nonetheless, as Jules says - it's good to read those and see what kind of things people are doing, even if its just getting a taste.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there's been a new paper on arxiv today (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189">https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189</a>) about learners, and actually we should have our paper on Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based Learning up on arxiv very very soon :)</p>

<p>If you follow machine learning in the same direction as us (which I <em>think</em> is the "canonical" way of taking seriously the existing compositionality of deep learning - but being wrong is always an option, there could be some totally different way you could go) - you'll eventually meet the question "what the heck does game theory have to do with anything"</p>

<p>As an outsider to ML, I don't have a good answer for exactly how it should connect.  But there has to be more than a superficial connection between learning goals and player goals, learning strategies and game theoretic strategies, etc.  Any kind of learning system/environment should at least be expressible as a formal game, and from there, game theory ought to at least offer some insights.  Same should apply to human learning, as well.</p>

<p>By the way, just because something is a basic observation doesn't necessarily mean it's an easy observation to make, especially for the first time.  E.g. it's a basic observation that the number zero is important to mathematics.</p>

<p>This is all true, but the connection been categorical approach to machine learning and game theory is more subtle than that. They're structurally the same. I think the true answer is actually closer to "game theory is a kind of machine learning" than the other way round - the central idea of compositional game theory turned out in retrospect to be a sort of "backpropagation of payoffs". In Strathclyde we're working towards a proper grand unification, but none of it's written down yet...</p>

<p>Similarly, for almost anyone in Italy there is no difference between ἁ and ἀ, and this causes a series of funny headaches when one tries to translate.

<p>Mhhh, Greek and Latin are more length-centered than pitch centered. On the contrary, many modern European languages are accent-centered. This causes problems especially in poetry, since ancient poetry is based on length of words and not on accents. Roughly, we could say that "A long vowel sounds like an accented one" but this interpretation causes many throubles very soon. For instance,  "Italia" and "Italiā" are different words in Latin (first is nominative, second is ablative), but on both the accent is on the first "a". I don't know how modern Greek behaves in this respect, but changes in Greek have been remarkably contained in its long history, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone tells me that it retained the length-based vowel system. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> I have some nice videos about Latin pronunciation, if you are interested!

<p>This is taken from the Iliad, and is in hexameters. To be read correctly, it doesn't really matters where the stress goes. What matters is that the alternance between long and short vowels is pronounced correctly.</p>

<p>Again, hexameters, which were what all the cool kids in the ancient world would use. The rhythm is given by long and short vowels alternating, defining a structure. I guess this way of doing poetry is deeply entangled with the fact that a) It was read aloud and b) It was accompanied by music.</p>

<p>Mhhh, no, I'm definitely talking about Ancient Greek, I never studied any Modern Greek. I don't know, I've never seen Ancient Greek phonetics presented that way. For sure, duration was very important and poetry was completely based on it. It may also be that what he calls "pitch" we call "duration", or that in a way or another we are talking about the same thing</p>

<p>Also, even if I wouldn't bet on it I guess Ancient Greek phonetics are well understood (starting from Erasmus, if not before) as compared with, for instance, Middle Egyptian and Sumerian. So I'm pretty sure that there is a way to concile what I'm saying with what he's saying, but for sure this is too specialized for me to give a satisfactory answer...</p>

<p>It really depends on how you define stuff. I'm quite eager to make game and learners the same thing, since their categorical semantics is so similar. One key difference is in the computation of equilibria/learning process, but they can be put on the same footing as well (by swapping a gadget attached to them)<br>
It'd be nice to link to a paper now, but there's not one yet on this : <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>If you take the definitions exactly as given in Backprop As Functor and Compositional Game Theory then in a completely literal sense you get a functor from learners to games (I wrote the construction in this short tech report: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666">https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666</a>), and I think not the other way. But in private we've been fiddling with the definitions of both so they are both subsumed under a single definition, since we had a gut feeling that it was a good idea. Mostly this involves making learners look more like games. In particular, almost all of the differences between the 2 papers arise from the fact that they're not talking about the differentiable structure that's in machine learning, they stick to Set (which in turn buys them some more generality to talk about other kinds of learners that don't use differentiation). Once you put the differentiable structure back into Backprop As Functor it <em>really</em> starts to look the same as open games - not that there's an adjunction or even an equivalence, but that they're literally the same category</p>

<p>Exactly - I'm still quite fascinated that it's now plausible to say that <em>exactly the same structure might be shared by learners and open games</em>.

<p>All this is very like functions between sets: there's no function from a nonempty set to an empty set, but there's always a function from a nonempty set to any other nonempty set, and there's a unique function between empty sets.</p>

<p>So interesting and so well explained! Thank you so much <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> . </p>
<p>So what are the implications of this? </p>
<p>If I have two categories, from two completely disparate scientific disciplines For example, and a functor between them, that of course by definition, preserves the original relations within the initial category, have you in essence discovered a way of describing one sceintific discipline in terms of another? </p>
<p>Or does this kind of benefit depend on the functor itself? For example, I can't imagine a trivial functor such as one that maps every object in the original category to a single object in the other, and every morphism to the identity, as one that introduces a new way of discussing relations and concepts between the two categories.</p>
<p>Or am I being completely idealistic, and a functor doesn't necessarily give you a way of relating scientific disciplines, or in general, discussing one category in terms of another?</p>

<p>My example of how to get a functor from any category to any nonempty category is pretty boring.   In terms of relating scientific disciplines, supposed you used this to relate geology to ornithology.  Then it would be saying "every rock is kind of like a penguin, and every way to turn one rock into another is kind of like doing nothing to a penguin".</p>

<p>I'm reading about adjunctions for the first time and having trouble seeing what functors fulfill the naturality requirements for the isomorphism of hom-sets. For Categories C and D, it would appear it would be the functors C-&gt; Set and D-&gt; Set are natural. Though Dr. Fong and Dr. Spivak's book seems to suggest it's C_op -&gt; Set and D -&gt; Set. But then again, the commutative diagram in the book seems to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>This is true when you have a natural <em>isomorphism</em>. Indeed, these are the isomorphisms of functor categories so it would be <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/evil">evil</a> not to consider two naturally isomorphic functors equivalent.</p>

<p>More bluntly, the answer to this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can functors that have a natural transformation between them be considered equivalent? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>is <em>no</em>, unless the natural transformation is an natural isomorphism.   This question is like asking "should sets with a function between them be considered equivalent?"   Indeed, the latter question is a special case of the former, since a set is the same as a functor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>:</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F: 1 \to \mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span><span class="mord mathsf">t</span></span></span></span></span>, and a function between sets is the same as a natural transformation between such functors.

<p>The point is: things should not be considered equivalent unless there is an <em>invertible</em> map between them; an invertible natural transformation is the same as a natural isomorphism.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364022">@Kale Evans</span>  John's using n-categorical language when he says "equivalent" here.  In the category theory literature, two objects are "isomorphic" when there's an invertible map between them. The word "equivalent" applies in a more general scenario.  For example, objects <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C, D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span> in a 2-category are equivalent if there's a pair of morphisms <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>D</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>C</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f:C\to D, g:D\to C,</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mpunct">,</span></span></span></span> but <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">gf</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> isn't <em>equal</em> to the identity on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span>, only isomorphic to it.

So in this case, "equivalent" means "isomorphic up to 2-isomorphism".  When talking about n-categories, they'll say that two objects in an n-category are "equivalent" if they're "isomorphic up to 2-isomorphism up to ... up to n-isomorphism".  So while it's technically true that two sets can be equivalent, or even two elements of a set, people usually use the terms "isomorphic" and "equal" for those cases.</p>

<p>Be careful: what exactly is the category you're describing here? Is a category whose objects are real numbers, and with one morphism between any pair of objects? That's what it sounds like from the conclusion, but it doesn't seem like the category you were describing, since these aren't really "maps between real numbers". Is it the category with a single object, with morphisms being endomorphisms of the reals?</p>

<p>No, isomorphism is a special case of equivalence, so any isomorphism is a kind of equivalence.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Isomorphism is the kind of equivalence that appears between objects within 1-categories (aka ordinary categories). If two objects are isomorphic, they will have the same relationship to all other objects in the category.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as a map between real numbers.  There's a function between the set <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{1\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span> and the set <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{2\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span>, and it has an inverse, so these sets are isomorphic.   But there's no such thing as a function between 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Of course you can <em>invent your own</em> concept of maps between real numbers, and you can say that there's a unique map from any real number to any other real number - but you've just shown that this is not a very useful concept, because it makes all real numbers isomorphic and doesn't do anything very interesting.</p>

<p>Mike was trying to sketch out a precise concept of "equivalence" that's used in category theory and higher category theory.   That concept has a precise definition.   Mathematicians also use "equivalent" in a flexible, loose way where you say two things are equivalent if they're the same in any way you're interested in.   I think you are using equivalence in the second way.  In the second way, you have a lot of freedom in deciding what's equivalent to what: it depends on what you're doing.</p>

<p>I see. My misunderstanding. I suppose I was trying to relate isomorphisms in category theory to equivalences in other fields, and that is not the right approach for sure.</p>
<p>I suppose it is my lack of experience that currently prevents me from seeing how isomorphic objects in a category are seen as equivalent as they relate to other objects in a category. I haven't seen an example that really illuminates that concept yet. So I was erroneously attempting to tease out special characteristics by creating a category that would model objects in concrete math that I'm more familiar with. Namely, the reals. But this is not the right approach. I think I'll have to continue to work thru examples to gain intuition of how isomorphic objects are usuful with respect to other objects in their Categories</p>

<p>Mike was trying to sketch out a precise concept of "equivalence" that's used in category theory and higher category theory.   That concept has a precise definition.   Mathematicians also use "equivalent" in a flexible, loose way where you say two things are equivalent if they're the same in any way you're interested in.   I think you are using equivalence in the second way.  In the second way, you have a lot of freedom in deciding what's equivalent to what: it depends on what you're doing.</p>

<p>That helps me understand the usages of the term <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> , thank you. I will continue my study to see how isomorphic objects can be seen as equivalent in the typical categorical sense of the term. I feel I'm starting to find that this is something you get a feel for with more practice. Most texts introduce the concept of isomorphism, but without an adjoining example of how isomorphims can be used, and how they should be appreciated. So I'm on the road to appreciating this property, and these comments have helped put things in perspective for me<span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Most mathematicians become familiar with isomorphisms of vector spaces,  isomorphisms of groups, isomorphisms of rings, isomorphisms of topological spaces, and isomorphisms of objects in various other famous categories before meeting the concept of isomorphism in its full abstract generality.  So, when they read a book on category theory, they already know how isomorphisms work in a bunch of examples: they know instinctively that isomorphic objects are "the same in every important way".</p>

<p>I had a question about compact closed categories and wire daigrams. </p>
<p>What is an intuitive understanding of what's happening in wire diagrams, representing a compact closed category? I understand that these categories have unit and counit morphisms that, when composed, are the identity morphism. </p>
<p>These morphisms are analogous to the cap and cup icons in a wiring diagram. So how can one interpret the diagrams with respect to the analogy?</p>
<p>Take the attached image. There's a cap and cup between the motor and the summation morphisms that represents weight. What exactly does that mean? That the morphisms between them amount to the identity morphism on weight?</p>

Then the caps and cups allow you to reverse the flow of information but without any other transformation, hence if you reverse it twice you get back the identity morphism.<br>
As you say, "the morphisms between [motor/battery and Σ] amount to the identity morphisms" in the following way: modulo some braiding, you could move the summation box to the right so that all of its input are fed directly from the left (via identity morphisms), and then if you use caps and cups to feed back the output of "Σ" to the "Chassis" box, you would get an equivalent diagram overall. Or you could flip Σ around 180 degrees (take its dual Σ*) and put it on top of the diagram, etc.</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking the defining characteristic difference between a  symmetric monoidal Category and a commutative monoidal category is  the latter's associator, unitor, and symmetric/commutative properties are natural identity morphisms as opposed to just natural isomorphisms? </p>
<p>I understand commutative monoidal categories are a special case of symmetric monoidal ones; I'm trying to get a good understanding of the additional requirements for the commutative ones</p>

<p>related question: when we say that a monoidal category is a monoid in Cat, what is the precise definition of monoid that we are using here?, and what is the technical term that we use to describe it in full? I guess we are viewing Cat as a 2-category here but one must throw the prefixes  'pseudo' or 'lax' in there somewhere and I am not sure in general what the right terminology is to describe the coherence conditions.</p>

<p>Right: when we want to be fussy we say a monoid has an underlying set, or it's a set <em>with extra structure</em>.   Similarly a morphism between monoids has an underlying function, or it's a function <em>with extra properties</em>.</p>

<p>That makes sense. I was sloppy with my description. Updated my comment. With regard to "tensor product" , I feel I've seen it referred to as that before maybe, but I mean the monoidal product, which is the correct way to describe it right? </p>
<p>In string diagrams, which are often used to represent monoidal categories, I've heard the "product" or two objects or morphisms described as a "tensor". This is the same operation right?</p>

<p>I see. Ok, Yeah, you're right. Very different concepts; I conflated the two, given I thought the only operation in a monoidal category was the monoidal product which apparently is also referred to as a tensor product, according to wiki anyway and some professors I've seen on video. </p>
<p>Is there a specific flavor of monoidal category that has this operation 'combining' or 'multiplying' two objects or morphisms defined, if it's not considered the monoidal product? Or is it just another way of defining two morpshims with same source target for example? Or, are they just the same operation given the category?</p>

<p>I don't understand that question.   Maybe the problem is that I don't understand what "this operation" refers to.   Which operation?</p>

<p>By the way, if you're working with categories enriched in commutative monoids, it's probably more helpful to write those monoids additively.

<p>Right.

I was in a multiplicative mood.</p>
<p>(By the way, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364022">@Kale Evans</span>: when Reid says "the monoidal operation" he is <em>not</em> talking about monoidal categories.  I would say "the monoid operation" to avoid this potential confusion, though it's obvious from context what Reid means.)</p>

<p>I don't know whether this will be helpful or more confusing, but there is a connection between monoidal structure and commutative-monoid enrichment.  Namely, if the monoidal structure of a category is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/biproduct">biproduct</a>, i.e. simultaneously a cartesian product and a cartesian coproduct, then it automatically becomes enriched over commutative monoids — and conversely, if a category is enriched over commutative monoids, then if it has products or coproducts they coincide and are biproducts.</p>
<p>In one direction, let's write <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>⊕</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m \oplus n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⊕</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span> for a biproduct, which therefore has <em>both</em> a diagonal <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>⊕</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m\to m\oplus m</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⊕</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span></span></span></span> and codiagonal <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>⊕</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m\oplus m \to m</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⊕</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span></span></span></span>.

<p>Nope! That's the exact reason that we can think of isomorphic objects in a category as being "the same": the morphisms from or to any other object transfer (bijectively) from an object to any isomorphic one by composition with the isomorphism.</p>

<p>I've seen both used in the literature.

<p>A perspective to take here is that "function mapping to a monoid" is something most mathematicians would say and not blink an eye, and "underlying set" is a thing most often said by the sort of mathematician who likes category theory a lot. I've heard many people say that making this distinction is overly pedantic. It's simply the sort of thing that a category theorist benefits from being careful about.</p>

<p>I see. Yeah, I've read papers that have used both terminologies interchangeably, and was wondering if one was different from the other. It sounds like in both instances, its just a map to the set, and there is not subtle differences to be aware of</p>

<p>I think everyone here was trying to tell you there's <strong>no difference</strong>, but for some reason they didn't want to just come out and say just that.... probably because it's kind of interesting.</p>

<p>For something like monoids there isn’t really a difference but it becomes more important when you deal with structured object which have multiple layers (e.g. schemes which have both underlying topological spaces and underlying sets)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In terms of intuition, I think of limits and colimits as being "extreme" or "optimum" with respect to some property. That is closely related to the the way I think about the existence of a unique morphism to (or from) these special objects.<br>
To take your example of the intersection - If we have two sets of interest <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span>, and we want to consider sets that are subsets of both, then the "biggest" such set (the one containing as many elements as possible) is the intersection of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span>.<br>
The union is similar. Again we have two sets of interest <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span>, but now we want to consider sets that contain both <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> as subsets. The "smallest" such set (the one containing the minimum number of elements possible) is the (disjoint?) union.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm just learning how all these things work myself!</p>

<p>An intuition I like to keep in mind (which isn’t always accurate) is that limits and algebraic and they ‘cut’ or ‘solve’ while colimits and geometric and they ‘glue’</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, limits and colimits are extremely general and formal notions. So the only way you’ll get any intuition is just by looking at a lot of very different examples.</p>

<p>A category has things called "morphisms" and some things called "objects", but they can be absolutely anything - we just need some name for them, nothing is required besides what's <em>actually in the definition of category</em></p>

<p>You should look at a gazillion example of categories to get the difference between functions and arrows and objects and sets. There are categories that literally are collections of sets with extra structure: </p>
<ul>
<li>the category of sets and functions, </li>
<li>the category of groups and homomorphisms, </li>
<li>the category of toplogical spaces and continuous maps, </li>
</ul>
<p>etc etc. But then there are also weirder examples of categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>a set is a category where the elements are the objects, and there's only identity morphisms,</li>
<li>a partially ordered set is a category  where the objects are the elements and the morphisms are just the relation of one being less than another, </li>
<li>a group is a category where there is one object (there's nothing at all to this object, it's essentially a placeholder) and the morphisms are the elements of the group, </li>

<p>Yes, and to add to this, relations are arrows in the category where sets are objects and relations are morphisms. But you could also define a notion of "morphism between relations" and end up with a category where relations play the role of objects. This may seem confusing, but keep in mind that the most important holistic principle in category theory is<br>
<strong>everything is everything else!</strong></p>

<p>That is, often what you really do in category theory is describing the same thing from different perspectives. For instance, you could describe limits/colimits as terminal/initial cones over a diagram, or as adjunctions. The things you are describing stay the same, what changes is the perspective from which you describe them.</p>

<p>Tools like limits, colimits, adjunctions, Kan extensions and others have indeed this strange property that you can basically define one using the other, and vice-versa. If you think about a concept as a cube, then defining the concept using one or another tool amounts to look at the cube from different perspectives, e.g. by looking at different faces.</p>

<p>But if 'everything is everything else', then nothing is not anything else. Given a statement, how do you determine whether a statement is true? Given a definition, how do you determine whether it is self-consistent? For example, in classical logic I can check each and every term to make sure they're well-defined and there's no contradiction; the truth of a theorem is determined by the truth table assuming the axioms or definitions.

<p>Is there an example from information geometry about what is a functor? While reading Čencov's 'Statistical Decision Rules and Optimal Inference', this concept appears several times in the introduction chapter (P57~59) and seems to have something to do with sufficient statistics later on (P75 Lem 5.12; P95 Lem 7.4) and appear with features such as 'covariant', 'contravariant', 'heredity invariant', and 'monotone invariant'. Nowhere did it mention 'adjointness' and 'Galois connection' but they seems to be relevant in this context.</p>

<p>I agree with John, you are probably not ready. But just to give a simple example, you may say that <br>
"A (small) category consists of a set of  objects, a set of morphisms, and some laws and axioms that must hold."<br>
In this case, you are considering the theory of sets as primitive, start from there and say what categories are. But there are also ways to axiomatize what categories are without resorting to set theory. Ad that point, you may say that<br>
"A set is a (small) category where there are only identity arrows. A function between set is a functor between such categories."<br>
I put the "small" thing in parentheses because it's not important to focus on it right now.<br>
...Here you are using category theory as primitive and defining set theory using that. Who comes first? Well, it depends on your point of view! The point is exactly that many concepts in category theory can be defined in multiple ways, that can be proved equivalent. Once you pick one, you can use it to define other concepts, or vice versa, a bit like in the example above</p>

<p>You mentioned classical logic, and well, in classical logic things don't come out of nowhere. You chose some axioms and start building stuff from there. Those axioms are your "primitive facts". You could choose different sets of axioms and get equivalent theories out of them. That is, the same theory can be axiomatized in different ways.

<p>I see. So I can accept that there’s no ‘definition’ for objects and morphisms, and in case there’s an identity and commutativity that thing is a category. What is not a category is for example a circular order defined on a set. Here the morphisms are orders and they do not commute. Taking identity operator away from any set makes it not a category. For example, the linear transformations between vector spaces as morphisms on objects. Taking the identity matrix away makes it less than a category.</p>

<p>I'm not quite following your line of thought, but for what it's worth morphisms often don't commute in categories.

<p>How do you understand the univalence axiom? What’s the difference between intentionality and extensionality?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those aren't really questions about category theory, but about foundations of mathematics, although category theory is relevant to understanding univalence.  In category theory, two objects of the same category that are isomorphic in that category have all the same "categorical properties".  E.g. two isomorphic groups have all the same group-theoretical properties, so that group theorists speak of "<em>the</em> cyclic group of order 3" because such a group is unique up to isomorphism, even though strictly speaking there are many of them.</p>
<p>The univalence axiom is an addition to the foundations of mathematics (which doesn't make sense if added to a ZFC-style foundation, but does make sense if added to a type-theoretic foundation) that eliminates the difference between equality and isomorphism for objects of such categories.  Under univalence, two isomorphic groups are in fact "equal", although this can be a misleading thing to hear at first because it arises by expanding the notion of "equal" so that it <em>means</em> "isomorphic", rather than somehow "squashing" or "quotienting" to force isomorphic groups to become equal in the original sense of "equal".  In particular, just as two groups can be isomorphic in more than one way, under univalence two groups can be <em>equal</em> in more than one way.</p>

<p>For the second question, we say that a statement or property is intenSional (not intenTional) if it depends on <em>how</em> things are defined, and extensional if it depends only on what those things are.  For instance, the morning star and the evening star are intensionally different, but extensionally equal (both being the planet Venus).  Mathematically, "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⋅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">7</span></span></span></span>" and "the number of exotic 7-spheres" are intensionally different, but extensionally equal.</p>
<p>You may have heard these words used to describe type-theoretic foundations of mathematics.  In this case, for historical reasons, their use is extremely confusing and often almost "backwards" from what it ought to be.  In type-theoretic foundations, there are (at least) two different kinds of "equality": a "judgmental" equality and a "typal" (or, more traditionally, "propositional") equality.  The typal equality is the "real" equality of mathematics, which is usually extensional: "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⋅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">7</span></span></span></span>" and "the number of exotic 7-spheres" are typally equal.  (It's also the equality that is expanded by the univalence axiom to mean "isomorphism".)  To be sure, sometimes one considers type theories in which the typal equality is not fully determined, e.g. function extensionality may fail, so that it is not as extensional as it might be; but it is always at least somewhat extensional.</p>
<p>The judgmental equality is <em>potentially</em> distinct from the typal equality, and thus potentially intensional.  One says that an "intensional type theory" is one in which the judgmental equality is truly intensional, whereas an "extensional type theory" is one in which the judgmental and typal equality coincide and are thus <em>both</em> extensional.  Unfortunately, this sometimes leads people to apply these adjectives to the typal equality itself and speak of an "intensional equality type" or an "extensional equality type", whereas in fact as I said the typal equality is <em>always</em> extensional (or at least aspires to be so) and the adjective really refers to the behavior of the <em>judgmental</em> equality.</p>
<p>Ironically, the univalence axiom, which is an ultimate sort of <em>extensionality</em> property for the typal equality, is inconsistent with extensional type theory.  Thus, it is <em>intensional</em> type theory that can actually be "more extensional", at least in the behavior of its <em>typal</em> equality.</p>

It's because the interior of a set and the interior of its complement are not complimentary, their union misses the boundary of said set.<br>

<p>So is intuitionistic negation an operator defined on the space now, which is different from complement. Is there a reason why we consider 'interior of complement' as negation of an event?</p>

<p>Is there an example of why Grothendick topos is useful? Can it be used to describe general relativity, as an example?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Topos theory is a framework for doing sheaf cohomology theory. So I will start by answering the question - why is sheaf cohomology useful?</p>
<p>Some theorems in geometry that were proved using sheaf cohomology were Cartan's theorem A and B. More generally Cartan and Oka developed a powerful theory based on sheaf cohomology that was used to resolve many problems in several complex variables. </p>
<p>This did not use Grothendieck topoi. Complex analytic manifolds are very nice spaces. Grothendieck invented topos theory to try and generalize  these methods to attack problems in algebraic geometry where the spaces are less nice. I am not a number theorist so I cannot explain the Weil conjectures to you (which were Grothendieck's direct motivation) but the Oka-Cartan theory seems like it is an accessible place to begin. The book "Analytic functions of several complex variables" by Gunning and Rossi describes this theory in whole. </p>
<p>In algebraic geometry the paper "Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents" by Serre showed that these techniques could be used in algebraic geometry as well. Perhaps more relevant because this paper is more directly related to Grothendieck's work in topos theory.</p>

<p>The geometric reason is that often geometric objects are only locally defined or satisfy property only locally.

Blechschmidt's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03685">Using the internal language of toposes in algebraic geometry</a> is a very accessible introduction to these ideas, in that he discusses locality and the use of internal language explicitly (but the geometric objects themselves are far older). He also bring much more examples.</p>

<p>Later, when Lawvere and Tierney invented 'elementary topoi', a lot of people started using topos theory to think about logic in new ways.</p>

I'm seeing this 'origin of category theory' slides in Chinese, which mentioned Poincaré on combinatorial topology, Noether &amp; Hopf on homology group, Poincaré &amp; Hopf on fundamental group &amp; homology, Carten Eilenberg on homotopy group &amp; modules &amp; derived functor, Eilenber &amp; Mac Lane on group homology. Is there a way I can understand these concepts and history better? Why is topology is important in geometry? Do people want to take limit on something? Where does that limit come from? Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? When people say 'algebraic geometry', what kind of geometry are they referring to and how similar or dissimilar it is to Riemanian geometry? Is there any code I can write to understand these better? What are the concrete mathematical objects that one can think of when going through the abstract concepts?</p>

<p>That's a lot of questions! I'll try to answer the one I understand, remember asking people is not subsitute for personal study and research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is topology is important in geometry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Topology is the geometry which studies properties of spaces invariant under continuous transformations. Contrast this with 'linear algebra' (which is actually geometry) which studies thing invariant under linear transformations, 'affine geometry' which does the same thing with affine transformations, and so on. So topology is important in geometry insofar as it is a kind of geometry. There's also a lot of cross-pollination between various kinds of geometries, so topological ideas went to influence algebraic geometry and algebraic ideas went on to influence topology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of math has implications in the understanding of everything else <img alt=":yo-dark:" class="emoji" src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/21514.png" title="yo-dark">, including mathematical phyiscs.

<p>I'd say any really good mathematical physicist should know most of this stuff.  They're basically not used at all in thermodynamics (though I can imagine doing it), and they're used only a little in general relativity, but they're used a fair amount in quantum field theory - some more than others.  </p>

<p>I think you need to learn all this stuff if you're really serious about understanding <em>space</em> and <em>symmetry</em>.   But it takes about 5 years, so you have to think a bit about what your goals are.</p>

<p>Actually you'd meet all this stuff <em>except</em> group homology in a typical high-powered year-long course on algebraic topology.  For example, most of it is in Hatcher's <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">free book on algebraic topology</a>.</p>

<p>However, he does the bare minimum on derived functors, and I don't think he covers group cohomology at all.   For both of those I'd recommend Rotman's <em>Introduction to Homological Algebra</em> - the old edition, which is much shorter than the new edition.</p>

<p>Why is topology is important in geometry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Topology is the geometry which studies properties of spaces invariant under continuous transformations. Contrast this with 'linear algebra' (which is actually geometry) which studies thing invariant under linear transformations, 'affine geometry' which does the same thing with affine transformations, and so on. So topology is important in geometry insofar as it is a kind of geometry. There's also a lot of cross-pollination between various kinds of geometries, so topological ideas went to influence algebraic geometry and algebraic ideas went on to influence topology.</p>

<p>That's sometimes called 'point-set topology' and it's surprisingly different from other flavors of topology, the more structural ones (I recently read a remark along these lines... but I don't remember). General topology is more interested in properties that might fail for spaces considered by 'elementary analysis', like separability or connectedness or compactness. The most spectacular applications of topology arise from algebraic topology though, where one studies algebraic invariants attached to topological spaces. Be careful though, since most invariants actually  depends only on the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy%20type">[[homotopy type]]</a> of a space, so on something even weaker than topology!</p>

<p>First, there's a huge amount to understand about group symmetry: the theory of Lie groups and their representations, infinite-dimensional analogues of Lie groups, principal bundles and the connections on them, etc. - any good quantum field theorist is expected to know this stuff, and you need algebraic topology to work with these things.   </p>
<p>Second, physicists have been exploring generalizations of groups including <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum%20groups">[[quantum groups]]</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-groups">[[2-groups]]</a> (which are categorified groups), <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/3-groups">[[3-groups]]</a> and higher groups.   Quantum groups are important in condensed matter physics and 3d TQFT.  People are starting to explore <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%222-group%22+AND+condensed&amp;searchtype=all&amp;abstracts=show&amp;order=-announced_date_first&amp;size=50">2-groups in condensed matter physics</a>.</p>

<p>[2]  In a category Hom(-,-) is a set.   Set theory is very useful in category theory, just like it is in most mathematics.   When you learn category theory it's like learning other mathematics: you don't throw previous mathematics that you learned into the garbage can!</p>
<p>(Again, experts may be tempted to argue with me here, since there are alternatives to set theory, but this is a beginner question, and a beginner should not be shocked that category theory textbooks use sets a lot.)    </p>

<p>It's backwards, though, isn't it?  Contravariant tensors, like tangent vectors, push <em>forwards</em> along a smooth map of manifolds, i.e. they behave covariantly, while covariant tensors, like cotangent vectors, pull <em>backwards</em>, behaving contravariantly.</p>

<p>That's old-fashioned terminology.   These days the terminology is changing.  A lot of people in differential geometry call tangent vectors covariant and cotangent vectors contrvariant, and I certainly did in the book I wrote.</p>

<p>Topos theory gives a different way of thinking about differential equations, but not really an "alternative" to differential equations.  As usual, we don't "throw things out" - we just do them better.   I wrote about Lawvere's work on topos theory, synthetic differential geometry and dynamical systems <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week200.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, I should add that very little work has been done on dynamical systems using topos theory, and if I wanted to study dynamical systems more (which I occasionally do), topos theory would not be near the top of my list for things to learn about.</p>

<p>I'm finishing  chapter 7 of the online course on category theory, very interesting! It seems that here we're making a lot of constructions in many different mathematical fields such as linear algebra and differential geometry very explicit, in a very succinct and insightful way.  I wonder if there's such a statement as 'use category theory to prove something', or is it just showing the structures? If it can 'prove something', what are the 'legitimate moves'? What is an acceptable writing or do people accept 'proof by diagram'?</p>

That is: there are two ways around the diagram, representing different composite 1-morphisms. In a commutative diagram, these composites are supposed to be equal, but there are situations where instead there is merely a comparison 2-morphisms in one direction or the other.<br>
For example, if the 1-morphisms are functors, the arrow indicates a natural transformation between the composite functors on either side of the relevant cell of the diagram.</p>

<p>The concept of "subobject classifier" seems nice for thinking about properties of objects! (We can think of a subobject as the part of the original object that has some value for some property of interest). The concept of subobject classifier appears to show up in the context of "topos theory". I read that the category of sets is a topos in the nlab article, but otherwise that article is fairly mysterious to me.<br>
What is another example of a topos, ideally one that I might be able to understand with a little work?</p>

<p>I tell my students: if you don't know much topos theory, and you're wondering if something is a topos, here's a good rule of thumb: it's not. (Unless it's a presheaf or sheaf topos.)</p>

These are precisely the abelian counterparts of Grothendieck toposes. A Grothendieck topos is a category of sheaves on a site, while a Grothendieck category is a category of "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span>-linear sheaves" on a "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span>-linear site". </p>
<p>If you have a Grothendieck topos, then you can turn it in a Grothendieck category by taking the category of abelian group objects in the topos. But not every Grothendieck category is of this form (I believe yours isn't). Intuitively, Grothendieck toposes are a generalization of topological spaces, and Grothendieck categories are a generalization of schemes.</p>

<p>Yes, it's <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mi>e</mi><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Set^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. One reason I chose that example is that one can work out by hand what the subobject classifier is like, and that's a useful exercise. It shows in particular actually that "logic" in a topos doesn't have to be Boolean. Similarly, for the topos of directed graphs, you can try working out by hand what the subobject classifier is there. (As a start: what's <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> for that case? Try not to look at the answer in the back of the book!) </p>
<p>Often I find that beginning students in topos theory want to go for the abstraction, but working out by hand humble little examples is invaluable and intuition-building.</p>

<p>I'm trying to work out what the subobject classifier is in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mi>e</mi><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Set^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. </p>
<p>First, we need to figure out what a monic morphism looks like in this setting. It seems to be a morphism that is monic in each of its components. So, in this case, a morphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h: f \to g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span> is monic exactly when its two component functions <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h_1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h_2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are injective.</p>
<p>Next, we need to figure out the terminal object. It appears that the function <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mo>∗</mo><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo>→</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mo>∗</mo><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{*\} \to \{*\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">∗</span><span class="mclose">}</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">∗</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span> is terminal.</p>
<p>Next, I wanted to figure out <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord">Ω</span></span></span></span>, working from this definition:<br>

<p>Hmmm. I've concluded that figuring out the subobject classifier in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mi>e</mi><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Set^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a bit hard for me at the moment. It might make sense for me to learn some more about working with pullbacks first, for example.</p>

<p>Similarly, for the topos of directed graphs, you can try working out by hand what the subobject classifier is there.

<p>With regards to directed graphs, I think the category of directed graphs is given by <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mi>e</mi><msup><mi>t</mi><mi>D</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Set^{D}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8413em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8413em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span> is the category having two objects, and two morphisms from the first object to the second one. This is because each directed graph is specified by two functions from a set of arrows to a set of vertices, namely the source and target functions.<br>
I don't know how to efficiently find the subobject classifier in this setting either, unfortunately.</p>

Generalizing from this, people realized that <em>every</em> category has its own form of logic, suitable for working <em>within</em> that category.  This is called the 'internal logic' of that category.</p>
<p>This idea is very broad and general, but topoi are categories rather similar to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">Set</span></span></span></span></span>, so their internal logic is rather similar to the logic you know from school.    The internal logic of a topoi is a well-studied subject, and when you're done reading <em>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</em> you'll know a fair amount about it: that book is a pretty good introduction.</p>

<p>No, a groupoid is just a category where all morphisms have inverses.   A groupoid with one object is essentially the same thing as a group.  So, if you have some way of understanding groups - and there are many - there's a decent chance you can generalize it and understand groupoids.</p>

<p>I agree with John, you are probably not ready. But just to give a simple example, you may say that <br>
"A (small) category consists of a set of  objects, a set of morphisms, and some laws and axioms that must hold."<br>
In this case, you are considering the theory of sets as primitive, start from there and say what categories are. But there are also ways to axiomatize what categories are without resorting to set theory. Ad that point, you may say that<br>
"A set is a (small) category where there are only identity arrows. A function between set is a functor between such categories."<br>
I put the "small" thing in parentheses because it's not important to focus on it right now.<br>
...Here you are using category theory as primitive and defining set theory using that. Who comes first? Well, it depends on your point of view! The point is exactly that many concepts in category theory can be defined in multiple ways, that can be proved equivalent.

<p>"One could, after all, simply require that there be a set of objects of the category, rather than bring in the airy word class." So it's more rigorously a 'class of objects' not a 'set of objects'.</p>

<p>Here I'm gonna go through a simple proof in category theory that says initial objects are unique. It's really fun to read his writing and he made it very precise and concise when building an example like this. I think what I'm doing here is like a 'categorical automata' that does category theory. First there are possible worlds that define a category as an objects with some properties, which includes a truth table, that the first row with a category and three properties: has arrow, has object, has arrows, has identity arrows. There's also equality, truth, false, and implications consisting of what's necessary for a truth table deductive inference, and proof techniques (are the proof techniques monads?) representing possible transformations from objects to objects. The automata is like a Turing machine (not sure if it fit into the definition of Turing machine exactly? I'm not a computer scientist, yet) going through objects and their properties and adding new arrows and erasing arrows (isomorphism, out of memory) and adding new properties (uniqueness) and erasing old properties (make it a category), where arrows indicates possible transformation of objects. The automata intuitively make the hypothesis that suppose there's something else (a distinction to be made here is that this is a proof by contradiction not a proof by negation, so hypothetical objects are okay, similar to proof by negation this is a 'proof by inverse' or 'proof by drawing arrows', the purpose of this is to find a 'hypothetical mapping', I suppose this has something to do with 'monads'?), if this is drawn on a paper it would be a branched out arrow pointing away from that new hypothetical object, and adding one tentative object on that table of categories, creating a new category and create a new possible mapping from that category, and commutativity of two arrows collapses the new object into one, making a new property of uniqueness of that initial object, and since it'a category one add this new object named as 'initial object'.</p>

<p>So yes, their proof is complete and fine.  Personally I'd do a proof with more words and no diagram, but it would amount to the same thing - it's just a matter of stylistic preference.  I prefer a "narrative" when it's not too lengthy.  But it's definitely important to see how you can prove things with diagrams in category theory.</p>

<p>I recently think algebra is really important because I just realized in my university math course on proofs we just went through set theory, truth tables, quantifiers, but without seeing the algebraic side of things. And then we went onto group theory but without seeing any logic side of things. My question to myself is whether there can be a unifying picture between the two, and what can be a good entry to these materials?</p>
<p>And then homotopy comes in started with propositions and proofs in analogy with spaces and paths, but I've yet to see a discussion on algebra.</p>

I tried reading Boole, Peirce, Tarski and the language seems very inaccessible to my level.

<p>That's also true of dozens of other subjects.  Did you see a course on knot theory, a course on projective geometry, a course on the lambda-calculus, a course on quaternions, a course on elliptic functions, or a course on the basics of p-adic analysis...?  These are all lots of fun and could make great undergrad courses, but most universities don't teach them because they don't have any faculty eager to teach them.</p>

This is necessary since, as we will see later on, the geometry of the orthogonal sum can only be appropriately described in terms of whole affine spaces which do not fit within the confines of the belief space, a simplex." "Strikingly, for any subset A, the resulting affine spaces have a common intersection<br>
for all k 2 [0, 1], which is therefore characteristic of Bel.". This is interesting because just at terminology-level I can see sensible correspondence.</p>

"We will consider also a situation when the system T contains not only equalities, but arbitrary formulas of FOL. In other words, we describe knowledge in some logical language and interpret its content as a geometrical image.", I understand this as saying geometry is necessary for giving semantics of first-order-logics.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="394227">@Peiyuan Zhu</span> With respect, I think that your development in your areas of interest will be greatly hastened if you spend some time trying to read just <em>one</em> thing from <em>one</em> angle on <em>one</em> topic. I am noticing that you are interested in a lot of very diverse things, which is very good, but I think this approach is not likely to lead to achieving (what I think are) your goals. I am also sensing that people here are starting to experience whiplash from the rapid turns from topic to topic.</p>

<p>That’s a good advice and I’m spending time on doing small things. The thing I’m trying to understand is semiotics, and this has been my goal. It’s really broad because whenever you’re using sign it immediately become an important part of it. And it’s not a joke that it is important to mathematics, physics, biology, computer science, etc. Of course in the end it has to be narrowed down to a specific field to work on and I’m now in the process of making something manageable and interesting and challenging. I think I’m coming close.</p>

<p>To quote from that interview “All the great quantum physicists, Pauli, Schroedinger, Heisenberg and even Dirac as well as mathematicians Weyl and von Neumann, failed to recognize its geometric meaning and the fact that it has nothings to do with spin. When you see the Pauli sigmas as vectors, then you can see the identity as expressing the simple geometric fact that three orthogonal vectors determine a unit volume. Thus there is geometric reason for the Pauli algebra, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with a spin. When I completed my little lecture on geometry of the Pauli algebra, my father gave me the greatest compliment of my life, which I remember to this day. He said, “You have learned the difference between a mathematical idea and its representation by symbols. Many mathematicians never learn that!” That really made me proud, because, actually, my father was very sparing with his compliments. So when he praised me, I knew I knew I had really done something good.” This is talking about semiotics in physics with geometry as semantics.</p>

In particular, I think the aim is often to figure out a language that makes mathematical thinking easier. For example, I remember seeing the argument that it's much more visually straightforward to prove some specific things using diagrams in 2D, as compared to using equations in 1D.</p>

<p>If you have access to it, you might consider taking a look at "18 Unconventional Essays on the Nature of Mathematics". This includes a chapter called "Towards a Semiotics of Mathematics". I haven't read this, but it sounds relevant.</p>
<p>I found this opening quote interesting:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/7NJihBA9rq98KczrOFmo7CbE/image.png">semiotics intro</a> </p>
<p>It feels to me that "What is the nature of mathematical language?" is one that comes up implicitly in the context of category theory quite a bit. In particular, I think the aim is often to figure out a language that makes mathematical thinking easier. For example, I remember seeing the argument that it's much more visually straightforward to prove some specific things using diagrams in 2D, as compared to using equations in 1D.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think he's advocating the process of iteratively building better algebraic structures by creating new, more succinct notations with deeper insight using the new distinctions drawn from geometry, combining the distinctions from the existing algebraic systems. In that paper, this process creates a Galois connection between the syntax space and the semantics space. But the distinction means that it's fuzzy in nature, mitigated only by new distinctions rather than definitions, as it will not fit into any existing algebraic structures. So I think this is where topos theory comes in. I don't know if topos theory has anything to do with Galois theory yet, but I don't think I'm talking about nonsense here.</p>

I think the author has been searching for a good geometric language to explain the theory, where he found some didn’t work like matorid theory, and some are helpful like lattice theory, some terminologies in algebraic geometry were helpful, and some he expects to be helpful like random set theory but I think it maybe too limited.</p>

<p>Re groups and lattices, there is a representation theorem from the 1940s that states that every lattice is isomorphic to a sublattice of the subgroup lattice of some group. But this doesn't mean that groups and lattices are the same thing, though of course it does mean that one can sometimes state useful properties about one thing in terms of the other, and vice versa.</p>

<p>You can think of a presheaf topos as the category of "actions" of a given category on sets (with groups as a special case of this). Sheaf toposes are full subcategories of presheaf toposes, so you can think of the objects of any Grothendieck topos as actions (and hence algebraic) in this sense.</p>

<p>I think we can be a little bit more generous than that, though I still would not say that toposes are generalisations of groups. The fact is that the 1-category of groups embeds fully faithfully in the 1-category of "strict" groupoids, and the 2-category of groupoids embeds faithfully in the 2-category of toposes. (I'm not sure if the embedding is full if we don't restrict to essential geometric morphisms.)</p>

<p>Is that more generous? Doesn't the embedding you're talking about amount to taking categories of actions? Or are you taking a larger class of groups than the "ordinary" ones with no extra structure?</p>

<p>One can consider groups as categories with a single object (or more specifically a groupoid with a single object), and a group homomorphism is exactly a functor between such categories. Any functor between small categories gives a geometric morphism between the toposes of presheaves on those categories. A presheaf on a group is exactly a right action of that group on a set, so we can consider a presheaf on any small category as a "right action" of that category.</p>

<p>Ok just want to make this more precise and work on a concrete example. I know two definitions of presheaf, one topological (as a function mapping from the topological space to some space) and one categorical (as a functor mapping from the opposite category to the category of sets). And I know definition of a group and why it is categorified as a groupoid with a single object (morphisms are group actions). Does a "presheaf on a group" mean the topological space being a group or the space being mapped from the topological to is a group? Or both? Shall I consider the symmetric group action on a finite set? e.g. <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>3</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X=\{1,2,3,4\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span> with permutations <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma:X\rightarrow X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">σ</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> But this gives a group exactly not a 'generalized group'. Are you saying we can consider a different action which is still a presheaf? By functor between categories are you saying we should consider two such symmetric groups? I'm not sure what group is homomorphic to that symmetric group, except a symmetric group of the same size. Can you give a concrete example of such an action that give rise to the geometric morphism that you're talking about?

<p>The morphisms of a group (viewed as a category) are its <em>elements</em>, not its actions. An action of a group involves more data, namely a set and a function encoding how each element of the group transforms the set. The category of actions has these as objects: the group is fixed but the set is allowed to vary. The morphisms are functions between the sets that respect the group action. Above I explained that the resulting category is a special case of a presheaf topos.</p>

<p>Do you think it may be helpful to draw a very strict distinction between logic and mathematics so I don't mix the two together. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that's hopeless.    There's no sharp boundary between logic and mathematics.  Mathematicians have learned that boundaries like this are arbitrary.   As soon as you try to create such a boundary, people will start doing very interesting work that crosses over the boundary making it impossible to say which side it's on!   More importantly these boundaries don't really help in any significant way.</p>

<p>I think it's also a physics question. It says "Relationist physicists such as John Baez and Carlo Rovelli have criticised the leading unified theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, string theory, as retaining absolute space. Some prefer a developing theory of gravity, loop quantum gravity, for its 'backgroundlessness'."</p>

It started from functions from a set to itself to relations from a set to itself. Each function can be identified with a matrix with a single one in each column, and each relation can be identified with a binary matrix. Then it says "We're thinking of them as matrices of numbers. Unfortunately we're still far from getting all matrices of numbers!". Why are we still "far from" getting all matrices of numbers? If we fuzzify the relations to integer degrees of memberships don't we get all matrices of numbers? What is the rationale here?</p>

<p>There is this paragraph from the page <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/groupoidification/#episode3">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/groupoidification/#episode3</a>: "The reason is that incidence geometries usually have interesting symmetries, and a groupoid is like a "set with symmetries". For example, consider lines in 3-dimensional space. These form a set, but there are also symmetries of 3-dimensional space mapping one line to another. To take these into account we need a richer structure: a groupoid!". A group action acting on a set with a group is also a set with symmetries. Are we referring to the fact that group actions form a groupoid here to motivate the definition of a groupoid?</p>

<p>Is this understandable from a 'geometric morphism' perspective where the weak quotient being the slice categories and the geometric morphism being isomorphisms? The direction of the arrows seem to point to the opposite tho so more like an 'under category'.</p>

<p>Good to know. I just sense that they are talking about vaguely similar things but I can't tell whether there's something indeed. Maybe it's just the idea of relationalism.</p>

<p>This paragraph "Given this, what's the meaning of a span of groupoids? You could say it's a "invariant" witnessed relation - that is, a relation with witnesses that's preserved by the symmetries at hand. These are the very essence of incidence geometry. For example, if we have a point and a line lying on a plane, we can rotate the whole picture and get a new point and a new line lying on a new plane. Indeed, a "symmetry" in incidence geometry is precisely something that preserves all such "incidence relations"." Is it talking about transformations of the entire space while leaving the relative positions of the point, line, and plane intact? I think I'm a bit lost when this page talks about incidence geometry.</p>

<p>Sure, I just remember some people told me it's just an analogy but not like Boole's work arguing algebra is more fundamental than logic, but maybe this was taken too literally. </p>
<p>How did topology enter into the picture of logic in history? For my entire life I never thought that they're related anyhow until encountering HoTT. Boolean algebra somehow is easier to see and well-known. Is there an "intuitive" reason for this?</p>

<p>Since you are interested in history, check out the historical introduction in Johnstone's book on Stone spaces. I think there he says something about how Stone discovered his duality.</p>

<p>They are incredibly important in the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">posets</a> (partially ordered sets); for example there's a version of the Yoneda embedding where you embed any poset into its poset of upper sets.   </p>
<p>I don't have anything interesting to say about their appearance in <em>applied</em> category theory.  But Fong and Spivak's book <em><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf">Seven Sketches</a></em> is a nice introduction to applied category theory that starts by focusing on posets.</p>

<p>I noticed Galois connection can pass on properties from one poset to another. For example, this can be formed by considering the closure dual interior operators of the lattice. I wonder if the same can be said for groups instead of lattices. For example, a "closure" operator on two groups that finds the least inclusive supergroup on some space that is weaker than a group locally. </p>
<p>In Modal HoTT book I noticed the sentence that by moving up the type hierarchy, "necessity" of a groupoid is invariant under group action (but I don't know what "possibility" is in this case?) I guess this is something relevant to what I'm looking for? </p>
<p>I don't know if my question makes sense. If not, please let me know.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by that.   There's a lattice of subgroups of a group, and this is fundamental to Galois theory.  But I don't know what the "least inclusive supergroup on a space that is weaker than a group locally".  Please define that.</p>

<p>I have a very beginner question: In the category defined by the ordinal number 2 (i.e. the category with two objects and one non-identity morphism), I believe the non-identity morphism is both monic and epic. Is that true?</p>
<p>If so, then (some) faithful functors out of this category would provide obvious examples of faithful functors that do not preserve monos/epis.</p>

<p>Yes. In any poset all maps are both monic and epic. This is because there are no non trivial parallel pairs to worry about making equal.</p>

<p>Another queestion is about sheaves. If a topological space is hausdorff and paracompact, then the cech cohmology coincides with sheaf cohomology. Why is the space required to be hausdorff? I am following the proof in Bredon's sheaf theory and it appears to me that the only  place where the paracompactness is used is in proposition 4.3. In this propositon, it is proved that every element in the čech cohomology is represented by an element in the čhech complex of an locally finite covering. So my question is, why is it required for the space to be hausdorff. Is it true in general, that the subcategory of locally finite open covering is a final subcategory of the category of open covering (seen as the poset category with the refinement relation) for a paracompact space <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span>?</p>

I got the reference from MathOverflow <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/18674">here</a>. I don't see at the moment where Hausdorffness is used in Bredon's proof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the reference - I found that Mathoverflow thread. I still don't understand why Hausdorffness is necessary though.</p>

<p>Neither do I.  And I don't understand this counterexample yet.</p>
<p>It sounds like Bredon's proof (which I haven't looked at for years) hides the Hausdorffness assumption very carefully.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that Hausdorff + paracompact is the minimal setting to have partitions of unity, maybe that's important?</p>

<p>I agree with John, you are probably not ready. But just to give a simple example, you may say that <br>
"A (small) category consists of a set of  objects, a set of morphisms, and some laws and axioms that must hold."<br>
In this case, you are considering the theory of sets as primitive, start from there and say what categories are. But there are also ways to axiomatize what categories are without resorting to set theory. Ad that point, you may say that<br>
"A set is a (small) category where there are only identity arrows. A function between set is a functor between such categories."<br>
I put the "small" thing in parentheses because it's not important to focus on it right now.<br>
...Here you are using category theory as primitive and defining set theory using that. Who comes first? Well, it depends on your point of view! The point is exactly that many concepts in category theory can be defined in multiple ways, that can be proved equivalent. Once you pick one, you can use it to define other concepts, or vice versa, a bit like in the example above</p>

<p>Going back to a previous discussion. What about a type in HoTT? What's the difference between a type and a set? (and a category?)</p>

<p>For the second question, we say that a statement or property is intenSional (not intenTional) if it depends on <em>how</em> things are defined, and extensional if it depends only on what those things are.  For instance, the morning star and the evening star are intensionally different, but extensionally equal (both being the planet Venus).  Mathematically, "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⋅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">7</span></span></span></span>" and "the number of exotic 7-spheres" are intensionally different, but extensionally equal.</p>
<p>You may have heard these words used to describe type-theoretic foundations of mathematics.  In this case, for historical reasons, their use is extremely confusing and often almost "backwards" from what it ought to be.  In type-theoretic foundations, there are (at least) two different kinds of "equality": a "judgmental" equality and a "typal" (or, more traditionally, "propositional") equality.  The typal equality is the "real" equality of mathematics, which is usually extensional: "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4\cdot 7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⋅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">7</span></span></span></span>" and "the number of exotic 7-spheres" are typally equal.  (It's also the equality that is expanded by the univalence axiom to mean "isomorphism".)  To be sure, sometimes one considers type theories in which the typal equality is not fully determined, e.g. function extensionality may fail, so that it is not as extensional as it might be; but it is always at least somewhat extensional.</p>
<p>The judgmental equality is <em>potentially</em> distinct from the typal equality, and thus potentially intensional.  One says that an "intensional type theory" is one in which the judgmental equality is truly intensional, whereas an "extensional type theory" is one in which the judgmental and typal equality coincide and are thus <em>both</em> extensional.  Unfortunately, this sometimes leads people to apply these adjectives to the typal equality itself and speak of an "intensional equality type" or an "extensional equality type", whereas in fact as I said the typal equality is <em>always</em> extensional (or at least aspires to be so) and the adjective really refers to the behavior of the <em>judgmental</em> equality.</p>
<p>Ironically, the univalence axiom, which is an ultimate sort of <em>extensionality</em> property for the typal equality, is inconsistent with extensional type theory.  Thus, it is <em>intensional</em> type theory that can actually be "more extensional", at least in the behavior of its <em>typal</em> equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Revisiting another old discussion: Can the extensionality vs intensionality distinction mentioned in this paper of Judea Pearl <a href="https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r107-shrobe.pdf">https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r107-shrobe.pdf</a> be understood in the same sense?</p>

<p>I disagree that this is "usually" the case. The only people who say this are people who have confused the meaning of a contravariant functor: saying this is the "usual" interpretation normalises incorrect usage. On the other hand, I think introducing both covariant and contravariant functors is needlessly confusing; in practice, people rarely talk about contravariant functors.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say "people rarely talk about contravariant functors".   It's true that when I'm out shopping and doing my errands I don't hear people talking about contravariant functors.   But I don't hear them talking about functors at all!   If you read math books and papers, you'll see plenty of talk about contravariant functors.</p>

But because it's so much clearer and more convenient to work with just plain functors, some of which have an opposite category in their domain, than to have separate notions of "covariant" and "contravariant" functor, in my experience no one uses "contravariant functor" in this sense any more.</p>
<p>If we accept that this is <em>no longer</em> the meaning of "contravariant functor", then the way becomes open to use the adjective in a different way without calling it incorrect.  For instance, we could say that a "contravariant functor" is a functor whose domain is an opposite category.

<p>Are you sure about that?  It's not clear to me that it's any easier to define "contravariant functor" without at least a braiding on your base of enrichment than it is to define opposite categories.</p>

<p>You're right: I had been thinking of the formalism in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0072313">Linton's paper</a>, but he only defines contravariant functors into the base of enrichment, not in general. In that case, off the top of my head I don't have an example of a notion of category that admits all contravariant functors but not opposites. I think the distinction is still useful formally, but that's likely not a sufficient justification for most.</p>

<p>Note also that in the context of my "contravariance" paper that you mentioned, opposites are an absolute colimit.  Thus, any 2-category with contravariance can be completed to a 2-category with opposites, in an idempotent way, analogously to the completion of an ordinary category under idempotent-splitting.</p>

<p>Yes, though if you are interested in a concrete example of a 2-category with contravariance, it may not be the case that you can give a natural concrete description of the completion of the 2-category under these absolute colimits (rather than talking about "formal opposites"), which may be slightly dissatisfying. I agree that this construction makes assuming the existence of opposites relatively harmless, though.</p>

<p>The sheaf condition depends on a <em>Grothendieck topology</em>, an extra piece of data consisting of a collection of "covering sieves". Which presheaves are sheaves depends on the choice of Grothendieck topology.<br>
For example, with the trivial Grothendieck topology (where only the maximal sieves are covering) every presheaf is a sheaf. At the other extreme, with the degenerate Grothendieck topology (where every sieve is covering), the only sheaf is the terminal presheaf, where all objects are mapped to the singleton set. Considering the walking arrow category, the presheaf which sends the initial object to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span> and the terminal object to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\emptyset</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8056em;vertical-align:-0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">∅</span></span></span></span> preserves arbitrary limits but is not a sheaf for the degenerate topology.<br>
The category over which you're taking presheaves need not <em>have</em> given colimits, but even if you replace preservation of limits with a flatness condition, neither implication holds in general.</p>
<p>All of that said, you might be asking about the special case of sheaves on a locale/space, where the category involved is the category of opens of a space (which is cocomplete) and the Grothendieck topology is the <em>canonical topology</em> where the covering sieves are exactly the effective epimorphic ones. In this situation, the sheaf conditions effectively translate to demanding that "sieve-indexed" limits are preserved. For example, products aren't preserved: if I take <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo

Preservation of limits is sufficient in this situation, but it's much stronger than the sheaf condition, so you won't find many sheaves this way.</p>

<p>Specializing to a topos theory perspective, sSet "classifies" the theory of total orders with a (distinct) tip and bottom element. So an adjunction between sSet and another topos E, where the left adjoint preserves finite limits and has domain sSet is a <em>geometric morphism</em>, and corresponds to a model of this theory (that is, a bounded total order) in E, and these are relatively easy to find.</p>
<p>All results about classifying toposes go this way around: to easily construct a geometric morphisms out of sSet into E, you need to identify a theory classified by E. Since that can be arbitrarily complicated, it's not as easy to find those.</p>

<p>In the paper The Rosetta Stone, John says "Computation entered the game around 2000, when Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang [41] showed that certain systems of anyons could function as ‘universal quantum computers’". I wonder how this project has been going and whether there will be ways to reach out to these people? Is it correct to understand that this approach is completely different from what D-Wave is doing?</p>

<p>The keyword is topological quantum computing, and a selling point for it is noise resistance. AFAIK, it hasn't been progressing experimentally as fast as the other approaches, but I do hear claims about experimental progress every now and then so maybe it'll pan out eventually?</p>

<p>As you'll see from the link, D-Wave has been doing "quantum annealing", not trying to build a universal quantum computer.</p>
<p>(Starting last year they started trying to build one, but they are famous for making their work sound impressive, so don't take this seriously until they actually accomplish something!)</p>

<p>In fact, I would be interested in hearing how generally people approach mathematical research. I did a statistics thesis but I felt like I was heavily reliant on my supervisor for intuition at that time, and get the sense of being dragged along throughout publishing that paper. I had a math degree but I felt like it was mostly me trying to pass the exams efficiently. What are the question that mathematicians ask themselves when they read a mathematical paper? I assume it isn't just about whether so and so is true, but instead we can ask what's the structure of these mathematical objects and what we can do about them?</p>

<p>How people approach research is partly a matter of how long they've been doing research, but there are things people can do just to get engaged and eventually sucked in (fascinated), which is a precondition for doing <em>significant</em> research, and many are things anyone can do at any stage of mathematical life. One is to seek out the really telling examples. Another is logical/analytical: if you have a theorem and its proof that you want to understand better, play little games like: could the hypotheses be weakened? Where do we use this hypothesis? What if I changed the hypotheses a little? Could the conclusion be strengthened? Is the converse true? </p>
<p>In my own case, a lot of thinking is stimulated by a sense that something could be phrased better, or at least phrased in a way I find more satisfying. Even such a little thing as developing notation that I personally prefer helps me. Anything that creates a feeling of <em>doing something</em>, even if it's a little thing, helps. In short, making mathematics your own, even if it's in tiny ways, is vital. </p>
<p>After you gain more experience, you can set yourself little challenges. You see a result stated. Not necessarily a big result, maybe a little lemma. But then don't look at the proof -- ask yourself: how might I prove this? Train yourself on little problems that naturally come your way, and develop a little independence. Don't google every damned thing, at least not before giving it the old college try yourself. </p>
<p>If you're reading a proof of something you really want to know, go over and over it. Once you think you've got it clear and settled in your mind, write up a note about it, preferably without peeking back at the proof. </p>
<p>Collect a bank of pictures and examples and lemmas. Oh, and <em>counterexamples</em>. Create over time your own personalized conceptual toolbox. </p>
<p>Write for other people, or as if for other people. With the idea "if I can understand this, then I can help others understand this". </p>
<p>If you have to break away from mathematics, try to end on a positive note. Some people (if they're writing) even stop mid-sentence, so that they can pick up right where they left off. </p>
<p>This is all off the top of my head, and it's stuff most anyone can put into practice, no matter what stage of development they are.</p>

What are the questions that can be interesting to ask in this case? </p>
<p>In fact, I would be interested in hearing how generally people approach mathematical research. I did a statistics thesis but I felt like I was heavily reliant on my supervisor for intuition at that time, and get the sense of being dragged along throughout publishing that paper. I had a math degree but I felt like it was mostly me trying to pass the exams efficiently. What are the question that mathematicians ask themselves when they read a mathematical paper? I assume it isn't just about whether so and so is true, but instead we can ask what's the structure of these mathematical objects and what we can do about them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially it is a game like this. Define a relation between the known and the unknown and the random seed via an equation. Repeat independent experiments to collect known, in order to estimate the sets of the unknowns. Your data is the result of a certain relation between the random seed and the unknown parameter instead of "following some distribution". Is there anything in geometry around the lines of "relational geometry" or "constructive geometry"? Does this look like something that has to do with "non-absolute space" in physics? You don't start with a prescribed manifold, you construct a space from relations.</p>

<p>Right. I always find myself severely underestimating the intricacy of small objects, thereby skipping important details and intuitions. What do you think about applications? Do you think about things happening in your everyday social life to be fruit for mathematically musing? Or is this helpful?</p>

<p>In other words, how can a Riemanian manifold be constructed via causal / near causal relations.</p>

<p>What are the question that mathematicians ask themselves when they read a mathematical paper?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First I want to make sure I understand the definitions of all the key terms, i.e. the words that appear in the main theorems.   By "understand them" I mean:</p>
<p>1) I know them by heart - if someone wakes me up in the middle of the night I can say these definitions.</p>
<p>2) I can explain why the definitions are interesting.</p>
<p>3) I can give examples of things obeying those definitions and things that almost obey them but not quite.</p>
<p>Second I try to understand what the main theorems say.   This means:</p>
<p>1) I know examples of things obeying the hypotheses of the theorem (and thus the conclusions).</p>
<p>2) I know examples of things that obey all but one of the hypotheses, and not the conclusions.</p>
<p>3) I can explain why the theorem is interesting.   This includes being able to say why the theorem is believable... or, alternatively, why it's shocking.  It also includes having some idea of what the theorem is used for.</p>

<p>Then, last, I go through the proofs of the theorems.   I only do this in detail if I am seriously interested in the subject.  The goal is to understand the proof so that I can reinvent the proof, not just memorize the proof.  But I may settle for getting a rough idea of the proof.</p>

<p>Riemannian manifold is a manifold first (which I assume you know). Then it has a Riemannian metric that's positive definite, operating on the tangent spaces.</p>

<p>I don't have much to say about information geometry beyond the <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/">20 blog articles</a> that I wrote about it.  Most of what I'd say is contained there... and it sounds like you've read those, or some of those.</p>

<p>I was trying to learn information geometry when I wrote those articles.  As you can see, I was doing what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> recommends: playing around with ideas, trying to make them my own by putting a new spin on them.   Instead of focusing on parametric statistics as people often do, I was focusing on the manifold of <em>all</em> probability measures, which is the "universal" form of parametric statistics (in the categorical sense).   I was thinking about the geometry of this manifold, mainly made into an infinite-dimensional manifold via the Fisher metric.  I was trying to understand the Fisher metric in terms of concepts I already understood, like relative entropy.   And I was trying to understand what this has to do with entropy and free energy in physics.   Later, I was trying to understand Marc Harper's work on information geometry and evolutionary game theory.</p>

<p>There's a lot of basic stuff about information geometry that I don't really understand.  Maybe sometime I'll go back and try to think about it.</p>

<p>I tried to convince myself that the Fisher metric is the "only thing it can be" but I didn't succeed. Is there a way to deduce the metric from the universal property?</p>

<p>In fact, I would be interested in hearing how generally people approach mathematical research. I did a statistics thesis but I felt like I was heavily reliant on my supervisor for intuition at that time, and get the sense of being dragged along throughout publishing that paper. I had a math degree but I felt like it was mostly me trying to pass the exams efficiently. What are the question that mathematicians ask themselves when they read a mathematical paper? I assume it isn't just about whether so and so is true, but instead we can ask what's the structure of these mathematical objects and what we can do about them?</p>

<p>In other words, how can a Riemanian manifold be constructed via causal / near causal relations.</p>

<p>Every important information that I wanted to say is contained in here. Is there anything that I'm missing?</p>

<p>Why do I want to do it: It's an important generalization called imprecise probability / Desmpter-Shafer theory. It's important because it's fully relational: the data is a function of a relation between parameter and "uniform randomness", i.e. a model is a relation between data, parameter, and "uniform randomness".</p>

<p>In other words, how can a Riemanian manifold be constructed via causal / near causal relations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don't know how the "in other words" is supposed to be segueing from "things happening in your everyday social life" to Riemannian manifolds that are somehow constructed via causal / near causal relations. </p>
<p>But since you asked how people do research, which includes two people trying to talk to one another in a context meant to be conducive to doing research, it may be that <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span>'s advice about learning definitions would be more useful here. What I mean is that when it comes to conversations that include relatively sophisticated concepts like that of Riemannian manifold (normally not encountered until graduate school), both participants should really try their best to speak precisely, otherwise the conversation may not go far, or become frustrating for one or both parties. Some sort of mutual understanding of how terms are defined quickly becomes vital here. </p>
<p>So, I'm sorry, but I don't have much idea of what you're talking about, and I'm not that keen on trying to guess. Things in my everyday social life do not form a continuum of points. "Causal relationship" to me usually implies an asymmetry, and puts me more in mind of Lorentzian manifolds than Riemannian manifolds. Do you want to try again? (Of course, I may not be the best person to talk with here, but I'm okay with walking a few more steps.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll give you an example about what I mean by "social life". Yesterday I was at a beginner dance class. After class I was like "Hey did we just danced like a pair of adjoint monads".</p>

<p>Ok, but does this tell me what they should look like "visually"? Since cosimplicial sets are the free cocompletion of 'finite intervals with distinct top and bottom with morphisms as interval maps (monotone maps preserving top and bottom)', does this mean a cosimplicial set can be depicted by a bunch of these intervals glued together?</p>

<p>To the extent that I try to visualize a cosimplicial set at all (which isn't much), I usually think of it more like a collection of "cosimplices" that are "coglued together".</p>

<p>The word written there is "probeable" or "probe-able", able to be probed. It's the idea of understanding some space by means of maps from some collection of simple test spaces, and how these maps then fit together.

<p>What do mathematicians value? In other words, what makes a theorem good?

<p>Hi a maybe naive question about terminology, I was reading <em>Catégories Tannakienne</em> (Tannakian category) from Neantro Saavedra Rivano, and I was then a bit confused about the 'post-modern' terminology. According to the Deligne article about the previous book Saavedra's ACU tensor-categories correspond to symmetric monoidal category. What about the differences between rigid category, autonomous category, *-autonomous category  ? what are the links between closure property and rigidity property ? And finally, is there a link between the property from an objet to being rigid i.e. automorphism group is trivial, and the rigid terminology mention above ?</p>

<p>Another mistery, Saavedra, talking about associativity constraint, explain the following : " the group of automorphisms of the tensor functor act on the left on the set of associativity constraint. Two associativity constraint are then said to be cohomologous if they are in the same orbit for the previous action. " Did you ever seen this elsewhere ?</p>

<p>I'm talking about associativity constraint for monoidal category, the one relate to the pentagon axiom. But I think this terminology of " cohomologous associativity constraint" is comming from Saavedra himself (or maybe from Grothendieck), but I could not find contemporary paper using it. I'm guessing that the reason is that this is a detail that does not lead to a result, the automorphism group of the tensor product is not appearing (as far as i know) anywhere in the rest of  Saavedra's text.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about equivalence of categories and am unsure about the following. Exercise 1.5.viii in Riehl’s <em>Category Theory in Context</em> asks to show an equivalence between the groupoids (affine planes) and (projective planes with distinguished line), both having as maps the structural isomorphisms. It doesn’t seem to be defined in the text but I take these to be minimally axiomatized, with just</p>

Somewhat intricate logic then seems needed to check A1 and A2. Functoriality by restriction is obvious.</p>
<p>Checking essential surjectivity requires you to know an inverse construction to this on objects: to the affine plane <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> add a new point for every pencil of parallels, and one new line containing exactly those new points. We then need to check P1 and P2. Then for fullness, we need to know how to extend an affine map between the outputs of deletion, to the points which were thrown out: the map must take pencils to pencils, and pencils of the deletion are in 1-1 correspondence with the deleted points. Faithfulness is trivial.</p>
<p>My question is, is the point of the exercise to do all these (to me anyway) nontrivial geometric things? Am I missing something? It doesn't seem possible that abstract (but still elementary) category theory could avoid this.</p>

<p>Perhaps one shouldn't ask for a solution which doesn't ultimately rest on these technicalities/checks. But what I'm wondering is: is there some way people carry around Proj and Aff as groupoids in their heads, which makes this equivalence clear/foundational? The reference to the Erlangen program in the question also makes it sound like the groupoids themselves are the objects of study in some sense.</p>

<p>So, I always start by seeing which looks easier.  I feel 1) is "better" if it's not too hard, because it's explicitly giving us a way to go back, while 2) just says <em>there exists</em> a way to go back: getting it may require the axiom of choice.   (If you want to avoid the axiom of choice there's vastly more to be said about this, but I don't want to get into that here.)</p>

<p>Yes. But I see that of course it required the same ingredients: thinking of what would have been the inverse on objects in order to check essential surjectivity, and on maps to check fullness. The only things abstracted away by using method 2) were having to think about the natural transformations and functoriality of the inverse.</p>

<p>I find the groupoid language confusing, especially here where it looks like these are just groups, ie. there is only one affine plane and we are considering its transformation group. So this to me looks like an exercise in group theory, and i have a guess about what the answer is.. But the groupoid language is supposed to apply more generally, when there is some kind of theory expressed in first order logic, and we get a groupoid of automorphisms of models of the theory. So statements like "consider the groupoid of finite dimensional vector spaces (over a field k) &amp; invertible linear maps" makes more sense to me as a groupoid. And I think there is a version of Riehl's exercise in a more general situation like this.</p>

<p>I'm slowly catching up here. It seems like you really are thinking of many different affine (&amp;projective) planes, including finite planes, etc etc. I was making things easier for myself by just thinking of affine &amp; projective spaces over a fixed field, like the real numbers.</p>

<p>Ah yeah, I am thinking of the full collections of models of the theory. So they are very disconnected groupoids.</p>

<p>In general, though, it seems the idea of "studying groupoids of geometric spaces of various kinds" might have several meanings/levels, and I am curious which is being referred to.</p>
<p>-We could study the individual groupoids as abstract categories up to equivalence (or even isomorphism). In that case it's not intuitive to me that there should be much to say.<br>
-We could study (still abstractly) the Cat-environment that these all create together--the functors and natural transformations which exist between them.<br>
-We could study the situation when one has <em>defined various groupoids as concrete categories of spaces</em>; and ask what categorical properties hold of the various natural and concretely defined objects/constructions. (E.g. every affine plane arises from deleting the distinguished line from some projective plane--essential surjectivity of the functor in the abstract language).</p>
<p>What does the Erlangen program actually do? Moreover, is there any sense in which the first two (abstract) approaches <em>are</em> really geometry? Is it ever possible for them to "reconstruct" or "recognize" that their categories/functors/nats arise from such-and-such concrete construction, and essentially no other, up to some notion of essential sameness on the concrete side?</p>

<p>Well, firstly, the Erlangen program deals with the case where the groupoid is a group. Have you thought about the Riehl exercise in this context?</p>

<p>Once you have both functors set up, I think it's not hard to check that they form an equivalence.   </p>
<p>If you start with an affine plane, add a projective line at infinity, then remove that line, you get back exactly where you started!</p>

<p>If you take a projective plane with a distinguished line, remove that line, then add a new projective line at infinity, the projective plane you get is not <em>equal</em> to the original one, so you should check that it's naturally isomorphic.</p>

<p>Right. I did just that for the exercise. But there’s no immediate abstract reason the categories should be equivalent just from the definitions, right? At least not without going into categorical logic.</p>

<p>How generally do you think it’s true that an equivalence of categories expresses some sort of logical equivalence between the data/content <em>defining the objects</em> on either side? This seems to be a pattern. E.g. after doing this exercise, wouldn’t one feel justified in saying something like “an affine plane <em>is the same as</em> a projective plane with distinguished line”? The notions are the same, and the equivalence is our formalization of that.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. So the exercise definitely shows in the single object case that the automorphism groups are isomorphic. And <em>that</em> is what we should look for as the sort of "semantic classifier"...</p>
<p>Can perhaps groups or more general categories actually do this for general first-order theories?</p>

<p>What do you call it when: (1) there is a finite set of equations involving constants, and variables whose values may be hyperreal numbers (or equivalent), and random variables with real values; (2) the usual arithmetic operations extended to hyperreal numbers (so to include ratios of infinitesimals, hence derivatives, including partial derivatives); (3) "equation bonds" which are predicates that are defined by identifying a variable appearing in (a side of) one equation with a variable appearing in (a side of) another equation. Such equations include ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic and probabilistic equations, discrete versions of all of the above, and all initial and boundary conditions. For example, if dx/dt(t)=f(x(t)) and y(0)=y_0, then identifying x with y converts the two previously unrelated equations into a single initial-value problem by "bonding" them along the identification of x with y. In other words, an equation bond constrains solutions of otherwise entirely independent equations. A solution to an equation bond consists of solutions to the equations which also satisfy the constraint. My question is, how would a categorist best explain "equation bonds" in general?</p>

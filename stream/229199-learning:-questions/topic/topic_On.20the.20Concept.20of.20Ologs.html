<p>[Beginner Question]: I am working through Spivak's textbook, <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em>, and am learning about Ontology Logs (ologs). There was a practice problem in the text book that went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an olog for human nuclear biological families that includes the concepts of person, man, woman, parent, father, mother, and child. Make sure to label all the arrows and that each arrow indicates a valid aspect in the sense of Section 2.3.2.1. Indicate with check marks the diagrams that are intended to commute. If the 2-dimensionality of the page prevents a check mark from being unambiguous, indicate the intended commutativity with an equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an initial first pass, I left out the check marks but came up with this diagram. <a href="/user_uploads/21317/NZ1zUN0fbZWySPoZPtZzl7gQ/family_olog.png">family_olog.png</a>.</p>

<p>When I compared my answer to his, he had something quite different: <a href="/user_uploads/21317/sP2Kqc_ugvUp7Y0iNhDuCyyU/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<p>His answer made sense after I reviewed it.<br>
It seems that with ologs, one should really only box together objects only when absolutely necessary.<br>
In mine, I tried using compound boxes to denote morphisms between objects all at once.<br>
I am just somewhat surprised that I didn't think to keep things as independent as possible.<br>
Does anyone have any tips or thoughts about constructing ologs in general or additional practice problems to think more categorically?<br>
Trying to build my category theory intuition but it seems like I certainly need more practice here!<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="483329">@Jacob Zelko</span>:</p>
<p>Looking at your first attempt, the thing that jumps out to me is your arrow Child -&gt; Parent. Even though "has a" often functions as a marker of a function in natural language, you always need to be sure the usage is unique. Since many children have two (or more) parents, this relation isn't a function. </p>
<p>I think that might be the reason it felt natural to put both the mother and the father in the same box further down the line.</p>

<p>In terms of checking your work, the best thing to do is imagine an intuitive scenario (e.g., two parents three kids) and use it to fill in the sets (tables) associated with each of the objects. In this example, you would have a Child table with one column "parent", and you would have to decide whether to put Alice or Bob as the parent in Timmy's row.</p>
<p>That mismatch is a signal that something should be modeled in a different way.</p>

<p>Ohhhh that makes so much sense.<br>
Your approach is really cool, I like that it exposes the flaws in thinking while you go through your approach.<br>
Also, as one final thought, when do you think that I one should put concepts in a box?<br>
To me, it feels like it should be more of a last resort.</p>

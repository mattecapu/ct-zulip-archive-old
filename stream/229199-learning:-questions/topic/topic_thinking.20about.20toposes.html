<p>An example of a site that isn't a topological space: well, any site for the topos of G-sets for a non-trivial group G would be such a site. These toposes have enough points, though.</p>

<p>A topos that has enough points is one that admits a surjection from a "discrete" topos. Every topos arising from a topological space has enough points. There are non-trivial Grothendieck toposes that have no points at all. For instance, the topos of sheaves on an atomless complete boolean algebra.</p>

<p>The importance of limits and exponentials and subobject classifiers is, frankly, unclear to me. Having them is extremely convenient –  finite limits, exponentials, and subobject classifiers in particular enable the interpretation of higher order logic –  but one has to take care not to be overly reliant on them because they are not preserved by general geometric morphisms.</p>

<p>I definitely would not say that geometric morphisms transfer properties of one space to another. That would be like saying continuous maps transfer properties of one topological space to another – definitely not true for arbitrary properties, and basically never true for any interesting property.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Technically a topological space is not itself a site. The site corresponding to a topological space is the category (or partially ordered set) of opens of the space, equipped with the "canonical" Grothendieck topology, where the covering sieves are those generated by open covers.</p>
<p>Another class of sites correspond to small categories: we can equip and small category with a "trivial" Grothendieck topology (where the only covering sieves are the maximal ones) and the topos on the resulting site is the topos of presheaves on the small category.</p>

<p>On the wikipedia of groupoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid#Group_action">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid#Group_action</a> says "any groupoid is equivalent to a multiset of unrelated groups" and in this reading "from groups to groupoids, a brief survey" <a href="https://groupoids.org.uk/pdffiles/groupoidsurvey.pdf">https://groupoids.org.uk/pdffiles/groupoidsurvey.pdf</a> says "emphasising the algebra we know rather than that which might evolve, which perhaps has led people to fail to see properly the advantages of an algebra which models the geometry more appropriately than the usual algebra of groups". What does the "algebra" here refers to?  When people talk about algebra, do they refer to one of group/ring/field or there can be more? In universal algebra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra</a>, an "algebra" on a given space X is an n-ary operation X. The paper also refer to Erlangen program as "study a geometry by means of its group of automorphisms" and gives an example of studying the symmetry of fibre bundles. What's "algebraic" about this example? Because I don't see any group/ring/field structure here. Does this example has anything to do with 'base change geometric morphism'? How are the groups in a groupoid usually related to one another?</p>

<p>If I have a space that can be decomposed into base and fiber, both the base and fiber are simplices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't what you mean by that - why should the base and the fiber be simplices unless you go out of your way to demand it.</p>

<p>In this particular passage he's advocating using a groupoid rather than a group to study symmetries; that's a common maneuver.</p>

<p>Is there a way to understand why ‘necessity’ here is “invariance under group action” on a G-set? And ‘possibility’ as the “fiber bundle induced by a group action”? Does the passage here suggest such modal operator exists between all subsequent levels? So each of the two levels considered topos slices modulo a base space, where a geometric morphism can be defined between them?</p>

<p>Are there (non-contrived) polycategories where it's crucial to restrict some of the structural rules in the codomain? Using my intuition from sequent calculus, I can see why you might want to restrict them in the domain, but I don't see what the constraint buys you on the other side... Hoping that seeing a real example will help get a better handle on how to think about this.</p>

<p>My current intuition, using the disjunctive sequent calculus interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakening in the codomain lets you add an output wire that will never go hot</li>
<li>Contraction in the codomain lets you say "If either of these two goes hot, feed the result into this input port"</li>
<li>Exchange in the codomain is harder to get an intuition for... At the very least it allows any of the output wires to be paired up with an output from an adjacent polyarrow, rather than just the ones on the edges. Note that you still want to disallow crossing between adjacent polyarrows unless you have exchange in the domain as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't get what would be useful about not having one of these.</p>

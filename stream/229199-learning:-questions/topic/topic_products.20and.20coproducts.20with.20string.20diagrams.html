<p>How do you draw products and coproducts with string diagrams? Is there a good reference that I can consult?</p>

<p>A common thing is to use the fact (attributed to Fox) that a monoidal product is cartesian iff every object is a commutative comonoid + all morphisms are comonoid homomorphisms, and dually a monoidal product is cocartesian iff every object is a commutative monoid + all morphisms are monoid homomorphisms. (There's a tiny bit more to it than that, but that's close enough.) That's a very easy way to get string diagrams, it's written in Selinger's "survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories"</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I don't really understand what all the presheaf stuff tells us about the geometric side of things? Can we actually go from meaningful statements about logics to meaningful statements about topological/geometric structures through topoi? <br>
Like can we go from Lindstrom's theorem to something meaningful about topologies maybe?</p>
<p>so i haven't really gone far enough into topos theory to have a satisfactory answer to this question but<br>
first of all like the reason topos theory was invented is that the category of sheaves over a space contains a lot of information about it, not just from a theoretical point of view that you can practically reconstruct it but from the practical point of view that sheaf cohomology, which is a crucial algebraic invariant which tells you a lot of stuff, already requires you in some sense to pass through the topos. so the fact that this category has a rich internal logic should be helpful somehow.</p>
<p>Second, it is sometimes less important that topos logic is an intuitionistic logic than that it is a modal logic. It is a kind of modal logic with respect to the Kripke frame of open subsets of the topological space, and it is naturally equipped with a certain modal operator , "locally", i.e. it is locally the case that P<br>
I think that historical arguments in geometry about a "generic point" in a variety can likely be interpreted as a kind of forcing argument in the sheaf of functions over the stalk<br>
but this is a very broad statement with a lot of details missing and I don't have a lot of examples<br>

Ingo Blechschmidt's PhD thesis is the main work i know of in applications of logic to geometry through topos theory</p>
<p>so anyone have an to answer this question?</p>

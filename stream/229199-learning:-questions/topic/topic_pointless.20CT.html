<p>An <em>arrow</em> has a source and a target. A <em>path</em> of arrows has each target equal to the next source. A <em>function</em> witnesses "Each X induces one Y.". A <em>functor</em> witnesses "Each path of X induces one Y.". A category is just a functor where X happens to be Y, and doesn't deserve particular attention, right? Except that the functor law only works right if the source and target categories are available to participate in the supposedly-unique inducing.<br>
And then one could presumably do the same generalization to make natural transformations, rather than functors, the basic building block. Can you recommend prior work?</p>

<p>It sounds like you're conflating the different presentations of the theory of categories. There is a one-sorted "just arrows" presentation and a two sorted "objects and arrows" presentation of (1-)categories. This can be lifted to 2-categories; there are 1, 2 and 3-sorted presentations of 2-categories, and perhaps you're describing what these look like for the 2-category of categories.</p>

<p>There can be advantages to considering the fewer-sorted presentations, but in practice people don't do it very often because the objects and morphisms have distinct interpretations. If you want to see the 1-sorted presentation for 1-categories written out, look up Freyd and Scedrov's book, <em>Categories, Allegories</em>. I don't know where to send you for the 2-categorical one, though.</p>

<p>Section 2.1 of Emily Riehl's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06801.pdf#subsection.0.2.1">Complicial sets, an overture</a>, which I recently happen to have read, recalls this definition in modern notation.</p>

<p>(You'll also see it in Dominic Verity's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410412.pdf#subsection.4.4">Complicial Sets</a> along with a veritable compendium of classical results on locally finitely presentable categories and other interesting things ... but if you want the original it's at <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/the-algebra-of-oriented-simplexes">https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/the-algebra-of-oriented-simplexes</a> ...)</p>

<p>This construction seems to me to work because the globe category is the Cauchy completion of a one-object semicategory (in this case an inversive semigroup) ...</p>

<p>... making the two of them Morita equivalent, which means they have the same category of comodels (the category of globular sets).</p>

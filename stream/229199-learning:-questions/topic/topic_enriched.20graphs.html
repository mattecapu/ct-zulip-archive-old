<blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure there's a whole conference dedicated to graph transformations, so that can't be true...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it's called ICGT. In that context, many usually employ the "classic" definition of graph transformation and try to generalize it in a way that plays well with the enrichment. I must stress that the focus is very different tho: most often one cares about graph rewriting that is done via single, double, sesqui-pushout and similar techniques. So in the end your definition of morphism is good as long as you have an adhesive category.</p>

<p>What I meant, btw, is that if you read an introductory text on graph theory, they will often define graphs but not morphisms of graphs.  Which compared to a ring theory or group theory course is very weird!</p>

<p>As long as they don't cover graph transformations I do agree. They may focus on stuff like hamiltonian/eulerian paths, centrality measures etc. But graph rewriting is a pretty big topic in computer science, I doubt there are modern books on graph theory that don't mention graph rewriting, if only tangentially</p>

<p>Idk what the standard for "modern" is, but I don't think <a href="https://diestel-graph-theory.com/">Diestel's book</a> says anything about rewriting, and I'm not sure if the book talks about morphisms of graphs either. Of course, it's a pure math book and not a TCS book, so maybe the situation is different with books written for/by computer scientists.</p>

<p>I was actually going to say that isomorphisms of gadgets are usually easier to define than morphisms.   </p>
<p>For example: in morphisms of monoids you get to decide whether the identity is being treated as structure - which must be preserved - or mere property, which needn't.  For isomorphisms, these two choices work out to be the same.</p>
<p>Similar issues show up in the various kinds of graphs, I think.</p>

<p>It's particularly frustrating since many combinatorial structures (trees, graphs, etc..) assemble into presheaf categories which means that there is a lot of extra machinery around that can be used.</p>

<p>What's the position of (the various flavours of) sketches in the category theory pantheon? At one point in time, there was a lot of work on these, but they seemed to have largely fallen out of use. [This was brought to mind by the exception that is the paper that just appeared today on the arxiv, naturally.]</p>
<p>Perhaps the better question to ask is: what is the replacement? What is the method of use today for what sketches were used 'then'?</p>

<p>There's no replacement; they are just as useful as they have ever been, I think, but there hasn't been much recent effort dedicated to them in their own right. In Johnstone's <em>Sketches of an Elephant</em> there is a nice comparison with other logical frameworks.</p>

<p>What surprises me is that I don't see them used much. They really do seem to be a nice specification mechanism. And seem to mesh well with the ideas of doctrines, for example. Though I have yet to see a good explanation of that - or of the relation with operads, for that matter, both of which seem to me to be rather obvious questions.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>'s recent work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15042">LNL polycategories and doctrines of linear logic</a> makes use of a (new) kind of sketch. That could be a good place to look if you're interested in relations between operadic and sketch-like notions.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is quite what you're looking for, but Kinoshita–Power–Takeyama in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404998001145">Sketches</a> describe sketches corresponding to finitary (2-)monads. If by "doctrine" you mean something like a 2-monad, then perhaps this is relevant.</p>

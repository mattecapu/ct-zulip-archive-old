<p>Is there a term for a commutative square of sets and functions (or in a topos), such that the "pushout gap map", ie the canonical map out of the pushout of the initial half of the square, is injective (a mono)? </p>
<p>If nobody has any better idea I'll write "weak pushout", although in the spirit of "weak (co)limit = existence but not uniqueness of mediating map", this term should better be used for case where the injection admits a retraction, meaning that the domain is as inhabited as the codomain.</p>

<p>Ahh, in Joyal/Moerdijk's "Algebraic Set Theory", they call a square where the pullback gap-map is an epi a "quasi-pullback", so I guess I can say "quasi-pushout" by analogy.</p>

<p>So the axiom of choice implies that quasi-pullback = weak pullback in Set, but weak pushout is a stronger condition than quasi-pushout.</p>

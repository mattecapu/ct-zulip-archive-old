<p>Are there any results on decomposing a Lie groupoid(appropriately) into sub Lie groupoids?  Like in the case of manifolds we have the notion of foliation.</p>

<p>Sir, can you suggest any literature in that direction? (Even if they are not results!)</p>

<p>I can give two examples, as perhaps that illustrates the general idea: cut up the manifold of objects into its orbits. If the groupoid is proper, then we know this is I think a Whitney stratification. By construction it is actually a decomposition of the groupoid, not just the objects.</p>
<p>Another example (again assume proper, for safety) is the decomposition into stabiliser types, which is a priori coarser than the previous one. Two objects x and y (points in the object manifold) have the same stabiliser type if the representations on the tangent spaces at x and y induced by local slices transverse to the orbits are isomorphic. Every object in an orbit has the same stabiliser type, but it could be that objects in different orbits also do. Then each piece of the decomposition of the manifold of objects is a union of orbits, and so again gives a decomposition of the whole groupoid.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about a decomposition into <em>subgroupoids</em> that's finer than the orbit decomposition. The only example I can think of is into the fibres of a groupoid extension, but I haven't checked the details (and so it might not even work!), but I don't think this is as subgroupoids.</p>

<p>No worries! I should say that since slice theorems are involved,  that's a good one to add. People to look for are Pflaum,  Posthuma, Tang, Crainic. But there are more.</p>

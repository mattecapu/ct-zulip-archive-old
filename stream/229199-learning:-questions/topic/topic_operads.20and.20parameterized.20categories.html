<p>As I understand it, a parameterization or para construction of a monoidal category C given as Para(C) inherits its own monoidal category structure from C, per the nLab (though the section is not written up yet to explain exactly how that is). Also, as I understand it, one can construct an underlying operad from a monoidal category in general, so then it should be possible to construct an operad around a parameterized monoidal category? If so, has there been work in this direction? Since I think it should be possible, I have been looking for it, but haven't found anything yet.</p>

<p>Right.  Jan: if you read the MathOverflow question (which I asked), and Tim Campion's initial response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang on - this shows that X is a finite colimit of (finite colimits of representables) -- a "2-fold" finite colimit of representables. But how does one turn this into an actual finite colimit of representables?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then his later answer, it should help.</p>

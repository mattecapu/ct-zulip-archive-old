<p>Right.  Jan: if you read the MathOverflow question (which I asked), and Tim Campion's initial response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang on - this shows that X is a finite colimit of (finite colimits of representables) -- a "2-fold" finite colimit of representables. But how does one turn this into an actual finite colimit of representables?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then his later answer, it should help.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  Right. BTW he writes: "Hom(x,-) commutes with colimits for x representable." Reading this, I have in mind something slightly different: that hom(x,-) preserves directed colimits. What's the difference between mine and his approach ? What does Djament mean by x representable ? There is yet a third possiiblity that x is a hom-functor but now we have already hom outside x.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't have the energy to think about this stuff now. Djament's answer is at least a bit mixed up, so if I were you I'd focus on Tim Campion's answer.</p>

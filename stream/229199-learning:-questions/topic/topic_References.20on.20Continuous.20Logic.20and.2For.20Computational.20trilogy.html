<p>I recently found the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09077">Categorical semantics of metric spaces and continuous logic</a> and as often happens it's very exiciting to see that people with actual academic positions are thinking similarly to you.I've been thinking about how to fuzzify category theory to use in categorical logic for structuring continuous stuff (optimization,machine learning) and have some barebones python code for a CT framework in python akin to the Algebraic Julia (which is very ambitious) ecosystem where you're able to replace strict equality with a metric for use in for example optimizing diagrams of machine learning models (those diagrams could be the semantics of a logical sentence so you're optimizing it's truth value).With the paper mentioned you could internalize category theory in a continuous topos with a continuous subobject classifier and formalize what I'm thinking about.But I haven't found any work explicitly mentioning computational trilogy and continuous logic or probability not studied through the curry-howard correspondence but side-by-side on equal footing.So my questions is - are there any?</p>

<p>This isn't an answer to your actual question but you might also be interested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10543">https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10543</a>, if you haven't come across it already.</p>

<p>To my surprise, there seems to be no such thing as "the analogue of a Lawvere theory, but the models interpreted in a 2-category with (say) finite products are pseudomonoids". Or rather, the precise definitions already in the literature seem to capture strict models (so, strict monoidal categories) but pseudo/lax model homomorphism (strong monoidal, or lax monoidal, functors): for example, Power's enriched Lawvere theories when the base of enrichment is Cat.</p>
<p>Do you have any pointer on this specific kind of 2-dimensional functorial semantics?</p>

<p>There was a project of Steve Lack and John Power on exactly this topic, but no paper has ever appeared. There are slides from a CT 2007 talk <a href="http://www.mat.uc.pt/~categ/ct2007/slides/lack.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Strict <em>models</em> don't have to mean strict <em>structures</em>.  There is a strict Cat-enriched Lawvere theory whose strict models are <em>non-strict</em>  monoidal categories: you just put all the coherence isomorphisms into the theory.  So, because strict theories are a lot easier to work with, a lot of the work on 2-dimensional universal algebra uses them, since there is no loss of generality in the kinds of structures you can describe.</p>

<p>Mike, I found a couple of papers by Yanofsky that make this a little bit more precise, but I must confess I still have to understand how this idea works! At first it seemed to me that he was considering only strict monoidal cats.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the point is not to capture weak models (for which, as Mike points out, strict models suffice), but to capture weak notions of morphisms, e.g. pseudo/lax/oplax, for which you genuinely do need a 2-categorical theory.</p>

<p>But I think it could be worth emailing Power and Lack to ask them about the work. I'd be interested to know too.</p>

<p>It's probably worth noting that Cat-enriched algebraic theories were considered by <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/6/n7/6-07abs.html">Power in 1999</a>. (Though it goes back even further: Gray also has some papers on Cat-enriched algebraic theories, for instance.)</p>

<p>the upshot of this thread is then that strict, Cat-enriched 2-theories capture pseudo-structure. I see Yanofsky's paper contains all the relevant information, but there's still sometimes that flies over my head <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> most likely, late night is the worst moment to keep doing maths</p>

<p>A lot more work has been done on 2D universal algebra using 2-monads rather than 2-theories.  It's true that the fully strict Cat-enriched notions don't yield weak notions of morphism directly, but you can still define and characterize such morphisms using strict monads/theories.  As Steve Lack wrote in his excellent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702535">2-categories companion</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2-category theory is a “middle way” between [enriched] Cat-category theory and bicategory theory. It <em>uses</em> enriched category theory, but not in the simple minded way of Cat-category theory; and it cuts through some of the technical nightmares of bicategories.</p>

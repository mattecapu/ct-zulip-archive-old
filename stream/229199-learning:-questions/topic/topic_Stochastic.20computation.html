<p>I'm trying to apply my knowledge of dynamics to understand open Petri networks. If I understand, both the most general dynamical systems and Petri networks with a stochastic element are computationally more powerful than the non-stochastic models.<br>
My question is to verify the enhanced computation from stochastic systems and stochastic Petri networks in particular.</p>

<p>I'm not sure they are "computationally more powerful" - it could be true, but I don't know any results about that, and one has to be careful when comparing deterministic models with stochastic ones.    </p>
<p>The main difference I know between stochastic models involving Petri nets and deterministic ones is that the former is good for modeling stochastic processes and the latter is good for modeling desterministic processes!  For example in chemistry the behavior of atoms is random and we model it using the "master equation", but when there are lots of atoms this randomness may become insignificant and then we use the "rate equation", which is deterministic and much simpler.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf">a free book</a> about Petri nets, the master equation and the rate equation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> thanks for the book, I'm reading it now.</p>
<p>What is a list of different systems and their computational power? I've already ordered them as best as I can based on the generality of their matrix representations. For example in dynamics the matrix could be anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Petri nets</li>
<li>Markov</li>
<li>Game Theory</li>
<li>Dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know much about "computational power" so I can't create such a list.  Furthermore there are lots of ways to use Petri nets to compute - I list a bunch in a chapter near the end of my book - and they have different computational power.</p>

<p>I'm definitely one of the worst people on this forum to ask about "computational power", since I've never seriously studied computational complexity, or stuff like the Chomsky hierarchy.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm interested in learning about category theory for projective geometry, and so tried to find the book:</p>
<p>Anders Kock: the category aspect of projective space</p>
<p>But it's not on amazon or online near as I can tell. How can I obtain it or something similar?</p>
<p>For context, for those interested, I was impressed with how well synthetic projective geometry supported "drawing intuitions". I was introduced to this via the book "perspective and Projective Geometry by Annalisa Crannell,..."</p>
<p>However, In this book an ideal point of a line l, is defined as the label of the set of lines parallel to l. The Extended Euclidean Space is constructed with devices like this. This model is almost immediately discarded after it's used to prove all of the typical Axioms for projective Geometry. </p>
<p>I was curious whether there was a more intuitive categorical approach for defining the Extended Euclidean Space, or what a categorical approach to Synthetic Projective Geometry might look like. Any recommendations?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

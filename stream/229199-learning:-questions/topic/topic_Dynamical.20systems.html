<p>I don't know what it means to say attractors are a "better" concept than equilibrium or fixed point.  They're both important concepts in dynamical systems theory.   It's like asking "what's better, groups or abelian groups?"  </p>
<p>I usually try to avoid ranking important math concepts by "goodness".  As soon as we start talking about that, any hope of a really precise conversation is gone.</p>

<p>I don't know what it means to say attractors are a "better" concept than equilibrium or fixed point.  They're both important concepts in dynamical systems theory.   It's like asking "what's better, groups or abelian groups?"  </p>
<p>I usually try to avoid ranking important math concepts by "goodness".  As soon as we start talking about that, any hope of a really precise conversation is gone.</p>

<p>I think mathematicians talk about "better" in the sense that it is more general. For instance, it looks like fixed points are always attractors but attractors are not necessarily fixed points. What are the cases when attractors that are not necessarily fixed points? Do they corresponds to some physical / biological reality?</p>

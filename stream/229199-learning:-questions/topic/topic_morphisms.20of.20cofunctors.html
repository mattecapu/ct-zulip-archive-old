<p>Thanks!  Maps of spans it is, then.  Unless I'm missing something, the cofunctors are special spans in Cat, so the resulting structure Cof should be a sub-tricategory of the monoidal tricategory Span(Cat) described by <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276631">Alex Hoffnung</span> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0560">here</a>.  The diagram you posted says transformations between cofunctors are maps of spans where the opfibration part commutes on the nose.  Because it commutes strictly, that allows only identity modifications between transformations.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276693">Bryce Clarke</span>, is there some reason you didn't consider maps of spans with 2-cells on both sides and the resulting modifications?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Mike, there are a few reasons why these specific maps were considered between cofunctors (viewed as spans). One reason, is that this is how natural cotransformations were defined in Aguiar's thesis <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Aguiar_InternalCategoriesAndQuantumGroups.pdf">p39</a>.  The second and more important reason is that these are the kind of 2-cells which arise naturally from the formal theory of monads II.  For a 2-category K, there is a 2-category EM(K) and when we restrict to morphisms of monads whose 1-cell component is a left adjoint, you get the 2-category of categories, cofunctors, and conatural transformations.</p>

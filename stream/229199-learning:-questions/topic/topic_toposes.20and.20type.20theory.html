<p>Why is Lambek and Scott's adjunction between the category of intuitionistic type theories and the category of toposes (with canonical subobjects) only an adjunction and not an equivalence (as usual, in these kinds of correspondences)? What would be the right flavor of type theory that would yield an equivalence with toposes and what would be the right type of category that would yield an equivalence with intuitionistic type theories?</p>

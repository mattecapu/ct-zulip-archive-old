<p>As near as I can tell from <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">https://clojure.org/reference/transducers</a> , a transducer is just a function of type "(whatever, input -&gt; whatever) -&gt; (whatever, input -&gt; whatever)" .  I can't find an actual axiomatization in the documentation (e.g. something like Haskell's monad API with its monad laws), but based on <a href="https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/">https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/</a> it seems like the author noticed that "map followed by filter followed by fold" fits the transducer pattern.</p>

<p>I myself am trying to understand it... I was wondering if there was a categorical definition, so that I could perhaps get a better grasp on the topic.</p>

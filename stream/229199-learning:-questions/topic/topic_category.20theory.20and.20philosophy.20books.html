<p>I find discussion on category theory that explicitly includes philosophical motivation to be extra interesting. I've been aware of the book "Conceptual Mathematics" by Lawvere and Schanuel for a while, but just a few days ago I saw mentioned on this zulip another book: "Sheaf Theory through Examples" by Rosiak - and I've really enjoyed looking at this so far.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there are any other book recommendations (or paper recommendations) that people here would make along these lines.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but recently Elaine Landry edited a collection called <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/35959">Categories for the Working Philosopher</a>, with contributions from a number of category theorists including myself.</p>

<p>I'm not a philosopher but I'm somewhat interested by philosophy and want to share a naive thought.</p>
<p>I've always thought that the transition from the set-theoretic view of mathematics to the categorical one was kinda the same that the transition between the two periods of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. </p>
<p>The first period is represented by the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus where he defends that the world of ideas is nothing more that an abstract formal system governed by classical logic. It looks very scientistic and reductionist,  reminiscent to the craziness of Peano arithmetic where you can use 50 lines to prove that 10 + 10 = 20. </p>
<p>In the second period (eg. the Blue and Brown Books), this view was completely rejected by the new Wittgenstein who put more emphasis on the study of the language as it is spoken by people and making philosophy a study of the "grammar" of the language, ie. how people interact and act using it. For instance, he likes to analyse what's going on if imagine I ask somebody to fetch a red flower, what this person is going to do, eg. if he goes in a field to chose a  flower, how is he going to determine if a flower is in fact more orange or red etc... At Cambridge where he was professor, he liked to organize practical experiments about the language with its students. Instead of lectures, they could play to kind of games of language. </p>
<p>For me, this view of the world trough language and actions resembles more to a categorical treatment of mathematics that the first one. Studying how people interact through the language is like studying how objects are in relations to each others through morphisms. </p>
<p>The part of the philosophy of Wittgenstein which is identified as interesting for mathematics is the first one but I think it's no more true and Wittgenstein who died (in 1951) just after the invention of category theory (in 1945), and probably never knew them, through the progression of its philosophy, realized a change of paradigm akin to the one in mathematics.</p>

<p>From what I've seen of Rosiak's book, I'm pretty sceptical. Philosophy is a positive addition to mathematical study to the extent that it provides concepts and accompanying terminology for reasoning about the subject or its foundations. In the passages I read, Rosiak introduces pseudo-philosophical terminology for concepts which already are more than adequately described by the categorical language. I'm specifically thinking here of the description of functors which preserve certain limits as "katholic" in that they preserve the "gatekeepers" for certain diagrams (universal solutions). We already have names for those things, and as far as I can tell this does not provide a connection to an established term which might lend insight to a philosopher reading this passage. But I might have been unlucky with my sample.</p>

<p>Those are interesting thoughts, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span> . For myself, as someone with less depth of understanding of the mathematical topics discussed in Rosiak, I just really appreciate someone spelling out in words what they think these concepts "mean" and can be used for, and how they can relate to models describing elements of everyday life. From this perspective, whether or not the book significantly employs or engages with well-established concepts in philosophy is not my primary concern at the moment.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when reading a math book, the motivation for defining a concept feels to me something like the following: "In chapter 7, we will want to talk about X. However, to define X and work with it, we first need to define and analyze Y." Unless I already know why I should care about X, this feels somehow disappointing, and I struggle to care about studying Y. So far, Rosiark is providing a refreshing contrast to this style of presentation.</p>

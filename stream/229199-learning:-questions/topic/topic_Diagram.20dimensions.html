<p>Hello all, in a neverending effort to get a more intuitive grasp of formal content, I just noticed something and I'm wondering if there is a deeper notion behind it.</p>
<p>The pentagon and triangle diagrams for the associative and unital coherence properties of a monoidal category are of course 5-sided and 3-sided. Moving up one  "dimension" to monoidal functors, however, the coherence diagrams become 6-sided and 4-sided, respectively. </p>
<p>Meaningless coincidence, trivial answer which I just don't see, or something more? Thanks</p>

<p>Hello all, in a neverending effort to get a more intuitive grasp of formal content, I just noticed something and I'm wondering if there is a deeper notion behind it.</p>
<p>The pentagon and triangle diagrams for the associative and unital coherence properties of a monoidal category are of course 5-sided and 3-sided. Moving up one  "dimension" to monoidal functors, however, the coherence diagrams become 6-sided and 4-sided, respectively. </p>
<p>Meaningless coincidence, trivial answer which I just don't see, or something more? Thanks</p>

<p>So, I imagine this has seemed like a silly question. At least for me it is not an important question, just a curiousity. </p>
<p>But, I have found papers discussing the combinatoric (digraph) properties of commutative diagrams (conditions under which gluing diagrams can maintain commutative structures), related to the work of A. Ehressman, who takes a different approach to applying category theory (primarily cone limits of concrete diagrams rather than monoidal categories).</p>
<p>Closer to answering my question though is probably the idea of associahedra: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron#Examples">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron#Examples</a><br>
"The two-dimensional associahedron K4 represents the five parenthesizations of four symbols, or the five triangulations of a regular pentagon. It is itself a pentagon and is related to the pentagon diagram of a monoidal category."</p>
<p>I don't yet understand enough to follow much in homotopy theory, which is evidently where this takes you. </p>
<p>Anyway, just pointing out it may not be an entirely silly question!</p>

<p>I was going to say: I think it's a coincidence that the  pentagon and triangle diagrams for the associative and unital coherence properties of a monoidal category are 5-sided and 3-sided, while the coherence diagrams for monoidal functors are 6-sided and 4-sided, respectively.  There <em>might</em> be some deep reason for it, but I can't see one.</p>

<p>There are a lot of nice patterns as go from monoidal categories to monoidal bicategories to monoidal tricategories and son: the pentagon gets replaced by the 3d associahedron:</p>

<p>I'd like to temporarily "unresolve" this just to point out that a lot of ideas underlying the connection were explored by Ross Street and Iain Aitchison around 40 years ago. In particular, lurking within Street's paper The Algebra of Oriented Simplexes is the combinatorics of associahedra, and the combinatorics of the polyhedral shapes associated with higher-order monoidal functors is lurking within a companion work The Geometry of Oriented Cubes by Aitchison. There are "Aitchison-Pascal" triangles which give rules for generating these polytopes. This is also connected with some old ideas of Dominic Verity for deriving parity structures on these polytopes in terms of some surface diagram theory he developed (and which I might be able to recall if I think enough about it). The PhD thesis of Sjoerd Crans is also relevant here, I believe. </p>
<p>I have to apologize for being so vague here; the trouble is, I've forgotten a lot of how this works and I doubt I can lay my hands on those handwritten notes by Aitchison (who is no longer in academe) that displays his Pascal triangle and his recursive rules. But it seems worth pointing out in case someone wants to take up the thread, and mining some treasure troves of all but lost ideas. My suggestion would be to get in touch with Street, who is much more organized than I am and surely still has a copy of Aitchison's diagrams. Meanwhile, if you guys know about certain secret tunnels of the "Russian underground", a doi for one of Street's papers which describes some of these ideas is doi:10.1007/BF00872948 (I'd link to it directly, but I don't know how this Zulip feels about such links). </p>
<p>So, it may be appropriate to mark this as unresolved after all, until I or someone else can revive the fading embers of such old thoughts...</p>

<p>It's sad that one might need to resort to the "Russian underground" to get ahold of a paper published by Springer, but in this case it's not necessary since it's on Street's website:</p>

<p>The mention of combinatorics of the Gray tensor product has made me want to start going through a recent paper I saw <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13725v1.pdf">on the combinatorics of the Gray cylinder</a> by Paul Roy Lessard. There is also Christoph Dorn's thesis on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10586.pdf">associative n-categories</a> that defines fully combinatorial models of higher categories, and conjectures that associative n-categories are the appropriate generalization of Gray categories. </p>
<p>Nick Gurski has also suggested to me the idea of operadic methods for categorical coherence problems. My response to this notion was to first find an appropriate decorated tree structure for things like transformations and modifications (utilizing work by Andrew Tonks, Stephan Forcey, and others). I thought it might be neat to turn some of the axioms from Gurski's book on tricategorical coherence into decorated tree versions, and included some below:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/21317/CPb-O0U1ruwlY-uyz8qekpOM/1.jpeg">an axiom for trimodification</a></p>

<p>Cool!  These look like things <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> would be interested in, since I believe he also created his <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/trimble/tetracategories.html">definition of tetracategories</a> with the help of trees.</p>

<p>As someone who has been building on the ideas mentioned by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> for years, I take exception to the notion that they are "lost" or "forgotten". But I have noticed that this thought is widespread among the "first generation" who has worked on these ideas. Rather, I think that they have been passed through the reformulation developed by Richard Steiner in the 90s and 00s, at which point they may have become not immediately recognisable to their originators.</p>
<p>In addition to my own work, only in the past 5 years I can think of work by Ara, Maltsiniotis, Ozornova, Rovelli, Gagna, Forest, Maehara, and certainly others that I have not mentioned, which descends from Street and Aitchison. Not forgotten and very much active!</p>

<p>I think one problem in communicating these developments is that, due to their combinatorial nature, they are often relegated to "technical" sections of papers whose intent is manifestly to prove some higher-categorical or homotopy-theoretic result. So it is easy to miss them!</p>
<p>I think combinatorially-oriented higher category theorists should more decisively invade the field of combinatorial and computational topology.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276363">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span> In that case, please accept my apologies (and this is very good to hear from you). I will try to educate myself better, and particularly with regard to Richard Steiner, whom I admire but admittedly somewhat from afar (I've been meaning to learn better his work on (augmented) directed complexes, which I am told is a big improvement on earlier work by Street and Power on parity complexes and pasting schemes; they are said to be much easier to work with.</p>

<p>Steiner's work on ADCs greatly elucidated the combinatorics of Gray products which generate the "oriented cubes", in comparison to Crans's thesis; then Ara and Maltsiniotis used Steiner's theory to do the same with "oriented joins", which generate the oriented simplices. </p>
<p>I would like to think that the Gray product and join of "regular directed complexes" that I've worked on are a further step towards understanding these constructions, as they connect functorially the operations on n-categories to their "topological" counterparts (cartesian products and joins of CW complexes).</p>

<p>Btw, I'm not a big fan of clicking on that check mark to say a question has been "resolved".   It may have been designed for computer programmers who find bugs and other issues with a piece of software; clicking "resolved" means we can stop worrying about that issue.  But in math, one question often leads to another in a delightful and productive way, and it's good to let the conversation keep flowing.   Only the most limited issues ever get "resolved" in a definitive way.</p>

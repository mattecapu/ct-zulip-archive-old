<p>I'm looking at this paper <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/open_markov/">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/open_markov/</a>. I wonder what would be the best characterization of open system? Does it mean the second law doesn't hold? It seems like there are so many different people saying so many different things. Does the system exchange energy and information with the environment or just energy? Or matter too?</p>

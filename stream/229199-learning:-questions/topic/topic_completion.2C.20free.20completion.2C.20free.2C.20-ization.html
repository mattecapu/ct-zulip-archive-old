<p>There's a bunch of names one can give to a left adjoint: completion, free completion, free ..., -ization. <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/completion">This nLab page</a> explains when to use which. To summarize (as far as I understand what the page is trying to say), we call a left adjoint</p>
<ul>
<li><em>completion</em> if it is faithful and its right adjoint is fully faithful;</li>
<li><em>-ization</em> or <em>-ification</em> if (it is not faithful and) its right adjoint is fully faithful (i.e., forgets property);</li>
<li><em>free completion</em> if its right adjoint is faithful and forgets property-like structure;</li>
<li><em>free</em> if its right adjoint is faithful (i.e., forgets structure).</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that correct? While I read the article rather carefully and most of the examples seem to support these definitions, I am confused about these counterexamples:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the page itself it says:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>By contrast, the forgetful functor from the 2-category of monoidal categories to Cat forgets structure, rather than properties, so its left adjoint should be called a “free” construction rather than a “completion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the forgetful functor from monoidal categories to categories is not faithful, since a monoidal functor is not determined by its underlying functor of categories. So why is one allowed to call that construction "free"?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why is one allowed to call the regularization of a cartesian category "-ization"?</li>
</ol>

<p>The rambling reflections on that page shouldn't be taken as gospel, but as an attempt to make sense of an <em>existing</em> hodgepodge of terminology.  So it's not surprising that it won't encompass all existing terminologies -- it's more surprising that any systematic classification would encompas so <em>many</em> of the existing terminologies, most of which were probably introduced in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner.</p>

<p>I could imagine someone making such a suggestion, but only in the context of 1-categories.  For higher categories, I think the criterion ought to go up with the dimension.</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Ad (1), this quote from the nLab page suggests that we should only use the word "free" when the right adjoint is faithful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By contrast, when we add structure to objects, i.e. we consider an adjoint to a forgetful functor which is faithful but not necessarily full, we usually do not use the word “completion” but rather the word “free”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by "the criterion ought to go up with the dimension", is there a reasonable definition of "faithful" for 2-functors such that the forgetful functor from monoidal categories to categories is faithful?</p>
<p>Ad (2), I read "regularization" at several places in the Elephant.</p>

<p>That quote says that we use the word "free" when we add structure, but not that we <em>only</em> use the word free when adding structure.</p>

<p>I don't mean the criterion for the word "faithful" but the one for the word "free".  If we're restricting left adjoints between 1-categories to be called "free" when their right adjoint is faithful, then I would say a left adjoint between 2-categories should be allowed to be called "free" when its right adjoint is locally faithful, and so on.  This "changing the goalposts" when we go up in dimension is, I think, another argument for <em>not</em> imposing such a requirement on the word "free", since it's better to be able to consider 1-categories as degenerate 2-categories without changing our terminology.</p>

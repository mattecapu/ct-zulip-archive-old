<p>So, in "Category Theory The Sciences", David Spivak tries to give an intuition regarding adjunctions by talking about how to translate sounds from "babies" to "adult words". I confess I was a bit lost in the analogy, and I was trying to come up with other examples of how to intuitively understand what's going on with adjunctions. At first, I thought adjunctions were like the Moore-Penrose inverse, where it's sort of a weaker version of how to invert a matrix... But it seems that this is not actually the case.<br>
Hence, my question is what are some good analogies/intuitions in order to understand adjuntcions?</p>

<p>To answer a question with a question: do you know a bunch of examples of adjunctions?   To my mind, a good stock of examples is crucial in developing intuitions.  Different examples suggest different analogies.  </p>
<p>Analogies come and go: you may decide one is great, then change your mind and decide it's misleading.  But examples last forever.</p>

<p>THE FOLLOWING IS THE ABSTRACT OF A (draft) 70 PAGE RESEARCH REPORT, "Microlectics, Mathematics, and Life."</p>
<p>Microlectics is a specialized language - a "microlect" - for expressing an intuitive model of specialized languages for expressing intuitive models. The proposal is a mathematical theory  combining observation of "real" patterns with invention of "imaginary" patterns of chunks - things or beings, and overt (e.g., conscious thought) and covert (e.g., dance) behavioral-patterns of beings. It introduces a spectrum of microlects, from poetry to philosophy to mathematics to code, for expressing intuitive models in minds of beings. Intuitive models resonate more or less, and resonances are invoked by encounters between things and beings and between beings and beings. The mathematical tool is a multi-dimensional linguistic topos. The objects are situations and the morphisms are events with propensities defined by probability and time. Stories are chains of situations and events conforming to a pattern (of things) or behavioral pattern (of beings). The algebro-diagrammatic microlect of the linguistic topos is a framework for expressing Five Laws of Biology, including formalized statements of the meaning and purpose of Life. The result is a contribution to the mathematical philosophy of biology.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like a rather questionable assertion in the light of modern theories of the origin of life (particularly the RNA world hypothesis). Could you state the Five Laws of Biology? A quick google search didn't produce anything concrete...</p>

<li>It seems to me that this is an article that you have written, which is why I suggested a topic in an existing stream rather than a standalone stream.</li>
<li>Since you haven't linked to/shared the report, it's not clear to me how the structure of a topos is involved, why it matters that it's a linguistic topos (do you construct the topos that way?) or how describing "multiple dimensions" makes the categorical structure clearer. I'm curious, though. Would you like to share more detail?</li>
</ol>
<p>3a. Is the assertion "Life is all beings" a semantic claim (that is, defining life to correspond to the collection of all "beings") or a claim of a different sort? What are "beings"?<br>
3b. In what sense "must" life persist? Is this a claim about the definition, that something must exist for a certain period of time in order to count as life, or another type of claim?<br>
3c. Is death also a clearly defined notion?<br>
3d. Are you arguing for biological determinism in this statement, or something less strong?<br>
3e. What are "multiple realizibility" and "strong-emergence of purpose"?</p>

<li>The research report is less than a rough draft, although all the content is in it. I am holding off on refining it into something that can be submitted, but it it is quite long already. If I had a Supplementary Materials section it would be even longer. So, I posted the abstract here to "take the temperature" in the community with which I most identify.</li>
<li>After a bit more feedback on the abstract, and the very helpful postings coming in here, I will start the refinement. As for "share more detail," I need to find out the best way to publish (ArXiv? Synthese? Axiomathes?...)<br>
3a. It is not a definition, it is an axiom. Yes, Life is the collection of all beings throughout all time on Earth. "Beings" is an "undefined term," and are distinct from "things," also an undefined term. Both are macroscopic "chunks" of "matter."<br>
3b. It is a probabilistic axiom expressed in a topos with a natural numbers object, and (with a certain assumption, Dedekind) real numbers.<br>
3c. Yes.<br>
3d. The axiom expresses a widely shared intuitive-model. Like, e.g., "two distinct points determine a line."<br>
3e. See multiple papers by G. F. R. Ellis. There is a reason I call this "mathematical philosophy," not mathematics.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Beware of premature axiomatization.<br>
3a. This distinction is rather mysterious. If you're asserting that Life "is" this collection of "beings", surely its properties must be determined by the properties of that collection. In other words, this amounts to a definition. Or are you saying that Life <em>includes</em> those beings but also includes some further structure?<br>
3b. What is the axiom?<br>
3c. What is the definition of death, then?<br>
3d. I don't think there is a widely shared intuition that "The development of every being is determined by a DNA molecule". Many conditions external to the molecule are involved in the development of (what I intuitively understand by) a being.<br>
3e. Unfortunately, G.F.R. Ellis' work is similarly inaccessible... Do you have a link to a non-paywalled pdf of his work somewhere, by any chance? Or perhaps you could explain these terms here?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reference material! Now I've read enough to understand the principles you mention; to save anyone else from searching, my quick summary is that "strong emergence" refers to phenomena which cannot be explained 'even in principle' in terms of lower level phenomena, and that G.F.R. Ellis argues that strongly emergent phenomena exist as a result of "multiple realizability", that the same high-level phenomenon can be produced in many ways from lower-level phenomena.</p>
<p>I personally find Ellis' analysis (on page 148 of the pdf you linked, say) self-defeating, but at least I understand more of the words now. Does "purpose" refer to the distinction between biology and physics that Ellis and Kopel make on page 126 of the pdf you shared?</p>

No, my ambition is to do something as important as thermodynamics. <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span> </p>
<p>I believe that Darwin's principles of evolution are formally derivable from my "Laws" of biology. Theoretical biologists and philosophers of biology are not adequately acquainted with mathematical frameworks that can express intuitive-models of autopoiesis, closure of constraints, and multiple time-scales. My framework does that. In other words, part of my audience is not experimental biologists per se, but mathematical biologists, theoretical biologists, and philosophers of biology.<br>
3b. Yes. The "laws" apply to Life as a whole.<br>
3d. Yes, citing an authority on anything is an appeal to authority. If I quote John Bell on the statement of a theorem and cite him for the proof, that is an explicit appeal to his authority as a well-known and highly-regarded category theorist. Same goes for Gould.  Every standard textbook on biology puts DNA at the foundation of molecular biology. It is called something like the "standard dogma of molecular biology." It is NOT enough, so is just one of my five "laws". Molecular biologists hardly talk about Life in its entirety, as I do. Systems biologists (with one of whom I have been collaborating for over a year) do not mention DNA much. Actually, not at all. My research report is a few steps above systems biology and molecular biology.</p>
<p>Quoting myself, "Beings are the meaning of Life and the purpose of Life is more beings." The words "being," "meaning," and "purpose" and "more" are technically defined in my framework. The word "Life" refers to all beings, for all time. </p>
<p>I found G. F. R. Ellis writings to be quite thought-provoking, especially his discussions of multiple-realizability, and the physics and biology to which he refers. I am particularly happy to see his arguments against the entire life-work of Kim, which voluminously argues against downward causation. Then again, the more I read G. F. R. Ellis I feel that his "argument" to get from multiple-realizability to strong-emergence begs the question. But it IS widely demonstrable in biology, including neuro-biology (Edelman's "degeneracy" is an example of multiple-realizability; see the MES work of Andree Ehresmann).</p>
<p>In my framework there are two kinds of chunks of matter. The beings and the things. Things have patterns, beings have behavioral-patterns. For example, things do not reproduce, beings do. To me the being-thing distinction is utterly fundamental, and far more meaningful than the mind-body distinction, or the fact-value distinction, or the materialism-idealism distinction, and the like. When a being dies it becomes a thing. There is a technical definition of that transition in my framework.</p>

No, my ambition is to do something as important as thermodynamics. <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span> I believe that Darwin's principles of evolution are formally derivable from my "Laws" of biology. Theoretical biologists and philosophers of biology are not adequately acquainted with mathematical frameworks that can express intuitive-models of autopoiesis, closure of constraints, and multiple time-scales. My framework does that. In other words, part of my audience is not experimental biologists per se, but mathematical biologists, theoretical biologists, and philosophers of biology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly sounds ambitious. I'll reserve judgement for the time being, then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3b. Yes. The "laws" apply to Life as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked because it seems to me that there are individuals who are incapable of reproduction for a variety of reasons, and counterintuitive that this fact should disqualify them from being-hood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3d. Yes, citing an authority on anything is an appeal to authority. If I quote John Bell on the statement of a theorem and cite him for the proof, that is an explicit appeal to his authority as a well-known and highly-regarded category theorist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely not. A citation is a reference to an argument that someone else has proposed. If you cite John Bell's proof, I can in principle verify that proof for myself if I am so inclined, and dismiss it if I find it contains an error, irrespective of Bell's standing. You have made clear that your five Laws are your original creation, so there is no way that Gould could have proposed an argument for this particular one to feature among them; it's that argument I was after. Fortunately you have outlined one after all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every standard textbook on biology puts DNA at the foundation of molecular biology. It is called something like the "standard dogma of molecular biology." It is NOT enough, so is just one of my five "laws".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It certainly is true that DNA is important in biology. But I was questioning the "development" being "determined" by a (single?) DNA molecule. Perhaps I'm just reading too much into the wording you've presented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then again, the more I read G. F. R. Ellis I feel that his "argument" to get from multiple-realizability to strong-emergence begs the question. But it IS widely demonstrable in biology, including neuro-biology (Edelman's "degeneracy" is an example of multiple-realizability; see the MES work of Andree Ehresmann).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like a good topic for a separate discussion, as does this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my framework there are two kinds of chunks of matter. The beings and the things. To me the being-thing distinction is utterly fundamental.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...but it looks like understanding these things will require a lot more effort on my part, so perhaps I'll wait and see if those discussions arise organically.</p>

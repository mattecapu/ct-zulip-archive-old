<p>A behavioral pattern of a being is a directed-graph of events (morphisms) in a topos of situations (objects). The topos is generated by "dimensions," i.e., ground-symbol types in Bell's terminology. These include, e.g., time and space and any other kind of values needed for expressing an intuitive-model. A situation is basically a point in a finite product of dimensions, so could include the positions, orientations, and shapes of chunks of matter. Chunks could be things, or they could be beings. The topos is equipped with additional structure, including enough for a real numbers object, and its unit interval. That provides enough formulas for stochastic processes to be defined. In particular, each event has a "propensity" leading from the domain situation to the codomain situation with a certain probability in a certain amount of time. (This is enough for a categorical generalization of the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm.) That is called a propensity. In other words, every situation has a propensity to transition to some subsequent situation.  What makes a being a being and not a thing is that beings have a non-zero probability (but no guarantee) of reproducing. Reproduction is the result of breaking bonds between chunks (e.g., cutting the umbilical cord). Development (e.g., the Life Cycle) is determined by DNA, in the sense that all the macromolecules in a being are generated according to the genotype. The events in a behavioral pattern are called its "means." Beings are the meaning of Life, and the purpose of Life is more beings. </p>
<p>Let me know if anyone would like to download the glossary (4 pages) of the draft research report , "Microlectics, Mathematics, and Life." Microlectics and the intuitive-model it expresses requires some mastery of its microlect, hence the glossary.</p>

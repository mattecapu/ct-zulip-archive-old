<p>The purpose of this stream is to use ideas from category theory and what I call "category-theory-adjacent" modes of thinking and reasoning in order to blend insights from various aspects of psychology, metaphysics, ontology, and so forth such that we can develop/modify modern education programs for K-12 (at least).</p>
<p>A main activity would involve formalizing a conceptual space that is capable of  exploring and extracting insights from various approaches to education, cognitive and developmental psychological models, reality representation, and so forth. Another would be to develop and socialize curricula to pragmatically share this with normal people, teachers, and of course children and students.</p>

<p>In case you are not aware of this, <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">NGSS</a> are undertaking a similar project for K-12 science. I found several ideas there to be sensible (I won't be more assertive because I have no background in teaching), so one could get inspired by their ideas and execution.</p>

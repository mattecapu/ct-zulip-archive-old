<p>The purpose of this stream is to use ideas from category theory and what I call "category-theory-adjacent" modes of thinking and reasoning in order to blend insights from various aspects of psychology, metaphysics, ontology, and so forth such that we can develop/modify modern education programs for K-12 (at least).</p>
<p>A main activity would involve formalizing a conceptual space that is capable of  exploring and extracting insights from various approaches to education, cognitive and developmental psychological models, reality representation, and so forth. Another would be to develop and socialize curricula to pragmatically share this with normal people, teachers, and of course children and students.</p>

<p>I have more to say about this, but I would like to see who is interested first. Please let me know your thoughts about what has been stated thus far.</p>

<p>In case you are not aware of this, <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">NGSS</a> are undertaking a similar project for K-12 science. I found several ideas there to be sensible (I won't be more assertive because I have no background in teaching), so one could get inspired by their ideas and execution.</p>

<p>I have given it a quick look. There could indeed be things to take from this as inspiration.</p>

<p>Hi xavier - many thanks for alerting me to this thread. (I saw you listed at ACT 2022, and recall that we first "met" at ACT 2020.) I have taught geometry, algebra, and workshop courses at the high school level, but now for several years I have been an adjunct instructor of undergraduate statistics, mainly at Endicott College, North Shore, MA. My real, urgent focus is on writing an algebraic and category-theoretic exploration of anti-reductionism. The working title is "Life: Microlects and Mathematics". If you like I can supply a rough draft for review as an attachment. (For the record, I might call myself an artistic mathematician.)</p>

<p>This is an area of active applied outreach, so anyone who is interested is encouraged to speak up. We do need to educate our children and youth today.</p>

<p>“If we group cherries and meat together under the attributes red, juicy and edible, we do not thereby attain a valid logical concept but a meaningless combinations of words, quite useless for the comprehension of the particular cases.”<br>
—Cassirer (1910) </p>
<p>This situation just described can be referred to as a “conceptual chimera.” Logically, it makes sense to be able to combine information in this way yet in practice it is meaningless. Distinguishing between well-formed concepts and meaningless concepts is the task of the type of conceptual-space-formalizing activity which would be a key focus of this effort as well as pragmatically applying it such that the effort has immediate utility to society.</p>

<p>Ideas are one thing. Action is another. Is anyone interested in taking action with me? Applied applied.</p>

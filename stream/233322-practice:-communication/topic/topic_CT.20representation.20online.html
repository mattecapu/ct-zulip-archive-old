<p>I've heard and believed for some time that category theory is <strong>overrepresented</strong> online meaning we see it pop up more often than it should compared to the actual proportions of mathematicians studying category theory. This is obviously my experience too, but I am clearly biased. I looked at the submissions for this year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some3">SoME</a>, and there is only one video on CT, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some2">last year's</a> had three. So I am not convinced category theory has a bigger place than it should.</p>
<p>Have you seen evidence of CT being overrepresented or underrepresented online?<br>
Have you felt that CT is overrepresented or underrepresented online?</p>

<p>I get the impression that category theory has a level of hype/evangelism that other areas of research maths don't receive, I think partially due to the popularity online of Haskell, and the fact that the basics of category theory are easier to learn than other "advanced" topics in maths (or at least are more standalone). That said, I don't know how much this translates into actual novel category theory content - for example because the amount of category theory one encounters when learning the main concepts of Haskell is fairly surface level. </p>
<p>I would guess this is what we see reflected in the SoME submissions: it's more reflective of the proportion of people who work deeply enough with category theory that they have the depth of knowledge to make novel expository content as opposed to the proportion of people who have dipped their toes in category theory and are talking about it online.</p>

<p>One of my theories about this is that category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet, which become obvious when you just think about them, if you understand the relevant concepts.</p>

<p>I think some people more than others are responsible for this (toxic) culture.</p>

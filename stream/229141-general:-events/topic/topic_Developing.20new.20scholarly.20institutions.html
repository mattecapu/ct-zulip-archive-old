<p>My friend Joshua Meyers, formerly a math student at U. C. Riverside, is trying to develop new scholarly institutions: alternatives to universities.  </p>
<p>He's gotten money from Jaan Tallinn and the Survival and Flourishing Fund to run <a href="https://let-me-think.org/scholarshipworkshop.html">Scholarship Workshop 2023</a> - a 2-month in-person incubator project.</p>
<p>It'll happen this summer.    In a while you can apply to join.  There will be room for 20 people.   Read more about it at the link!</p>

<p>Interesting... I followed a couple of links there and arrived at the <a href="https://let-me-think.org/index.html">Let Me Think</a> homepage. I have several (somewhat critical) questions; <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280784">@Joshua Meyers</span> is here a good place to pose those?</p>

<p>I'd love a conversation about it here, I'm not sure he visits this place often enough to make that an efficient way to reach him.  We'll see!</p>

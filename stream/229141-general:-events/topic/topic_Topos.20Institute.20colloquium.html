<p>The Topos Institute has a <a href="http://colloquium">colloquium</a> every week, which (alas) is usually not announced here.  But this week it's about work that a bunch of us have been doing on software for modeling epidemics, so I'm going to advertise it!  </p>
<p>The talk is by my old grad school pal Nate Osgood.  He's a computer scientist, he helped lead Canada's COVID modeling, and he is now spear-heading a project to develop software in AlgebraicJulia that uses ideas such as decorated cospans and operads to create disease models. </p>
<p>I am completely biased, since I'm involved in this - but I am really excited about how <em>category theory</em>, <em>computer science</em> and <em>epidemiology</em> are meeting in this project, and yielding practical tools for public health.</p>

<p><strong>Towards Compositional System Dynamics for Public Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> For decades, System Dynamics (SD) modeling has served as a prominent, diagram-centric methodology used for public health modeling. Much of its strength arises from its versatile use of 3 types of diagrams, with each serving both to elevate transparency across the interdisciplinary teams responsible for most impactful models, and to reason about patterns of system behavior. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are used in semi-qualitative processes early in the modeling process and seek to support insight into feedback structure, behavioral modes, and leverage points. As modeling proceeds, system structure diagrams further distinguish stocks (accumulations) from flows and material from informational dependencies. Stock &amp; flow diagrams build on that representation to characterize mathematical dependencies, quantify parameters and initial values for stocks, and have been particularly widely used in scenario simulation in public health and mathematical epidemiology. While ubiquitous use of diagrams renders SD modeling markedly effective in supporting team science and shaping stakeholdersâ€™ mental models, existing tools suffer from a number of shortcomings. These include poor support for modularity, cumbersome and obscurant model stratification, and an inability to capture the relationships between the 3 diagram types. Within this talk, we describe initial progress towards creating a framework for compositional System Dynamics, including theory, API support via StockFlow.jl within AlgebraicJulia, and ModelCollab -- a real-time collaborative tool to support interdisciplinary teams in modularly building, composing and flexibly analyzing Stock &amp; Flow diagrams. Our approach separates syntax from semantics, and characterizes diagrams using copresheaves with a schema category. Diagram composition draws on the theory of structured cospans and undirected wiring diagrams, and employs pullbacks for model stratification. Model interpretation is achieved via functorial semantics, with ordinary differential equations being just one of several semantic domains supported. After describing the current state of implementation, we describe plans for future work, including enriching support for CLDs, and adding support for several computational statistics algorithms and additional types of structurally-informed model analyses. This is joint work with John Baez, Evan Patterson, Nicholas Meadows, Sophie Libkind, Alex Alegre and Eric Redekopp.</p>

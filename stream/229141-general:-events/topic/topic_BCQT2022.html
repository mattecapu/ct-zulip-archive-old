<p>We are pleased to announce that pre-registration for the London Mathematical Society Research School "Bicategories, categorification and quantum theory”, to be held 11th-15th July 2022 at the University of Leeds, is now open. </p>
<p>The school will include mini-courses on Bicategories (Richard Garner, Macquarie University), Monoidal categories like that of Hilbert Spaces (Chris Heunen, University of Edinburgh), Categorification (Marco Mackaay, University of Algarve) and Hopf Algebras (Sonia Natale, Universidad National de Córdoba), as well as tutorials.</p>
<p>You can pre-register by visiting the web page </p>
<p><a href="https://conferences.leeds.ac.uk/bcqt2022/">https://conferences.leeds.ac.uk/bcqt2022/</a></p>
<p>and following the relevant link. The deadline for pre-registration is <strong>Friday 29th April 2022</strong>. </p>

<p>I think that our reading group on Joy of Abstraction on the Applied Category Theory discord server is really turning out well. It is on Fridays at 10am PDT. Hope others will consider joining us as we get into the deeper mathematical part of the book. We have good discussions on the chapter and we have started a new group that actually reads the book together as well. Joy of Abstraction by E. Cheng has turned out to be an excellent introductory book to Category Theory and it is much better to discuss it with others than merely struggle on to try to learn it by one's self. Please join our study group if you are interested in getting a start on or reviewing Category Theory. We try to keep up with the Book Club that Dr. Cheng holds where she answers submitted questions from readers and publishes videos on each chapter. <a href="https://discord.gg/hTEpgYv">https://discord.gg/hTEpgYv</a> <a href="https://topos.site/joa-bookclub/">https://topos.site/joa-bookclub/</a></p>

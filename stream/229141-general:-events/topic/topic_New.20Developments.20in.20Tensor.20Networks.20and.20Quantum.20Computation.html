<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the exciting new developments in quantum computing using tensor network techniques, Miles Stoudenmire and I organized a couple of events next week.  The first is a tutorial on the subject on Tuesday, Nov 1 from 1:30 — 3:00.  Miles is conducting the tutorial and he’ll give an overview of the fundamental ideas.  The second event is a one-day symposium on Friday November 4, the program runs from 9:00am — 5:00pm.</p>
<p>Here are links to events with more information, including a registration form to register to attend in person at CUNY Graduate Center or virtually on Zoom (we’ll send a zoom link later).</p>

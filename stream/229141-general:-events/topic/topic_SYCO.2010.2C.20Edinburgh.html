<p>CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS<br>
TENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 10)</p>
<p>Edinburgh, United Kingdom<br>
19-20 December, 2022</p>
<p>Submission deadline:  Monday 7 November 2022<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/10/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/10/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary<br>
series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers<br>
interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and<br>
abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a<br>
unifying common language. Previous SYCO events have been held in<br>
Birmingham, Strathclyde, Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,<br>
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of<br>
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading<br>
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature<br>
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and<br>
junior researchers, including students. Submissions is easy, with no<br>
formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so<br>
work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere.<br>
You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a<br>
PhD or Masters thesis.</p>
<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions<br>
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in<br>
particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and<br>
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language<br>
processing and machine learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and<br>
reaction networks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,<br>
type theory and game semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal<br>
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and<br>
relationships to homotopy theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation<br>
theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof<br>
assistants, and game theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world<br>
problem descriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES </strong></p>
<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>Submission deadline: Monday 7 November, 2022<br>
Author notification: Sunday 20 November, 2022<br>
Symposium dates: Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 December 2022</p>
<p><strong> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS </strong></p>
<p>Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 10 submission page:<br>
<a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium">https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium</a></p>
<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.<br>
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even<br>
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively:<br>
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even<br>
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>
<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can<br>
be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose<br>
to <em>defer</em> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject<br>
them. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO<br>
meeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be<br>
prioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held<br>
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>
<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO<br>
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 10; you still<br>
need to submit it again through OpenReview. When submitting, append the<br>
words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X"<br>
with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any<br>
documents.</p>
<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>
<p>The PC chair is Robin Kaarsgaard, University of Edinburgh. The Programme<br>
Committee will be announced soon.</p>
<p><strong> STEERING COMMITTEE </strong></p>
<p>Ross Duncan, University of Strathclyde<br>
Chris Heunen, University of Edinburgh<br>
Dominic Horsman, University of Oxford<br>
Aleks Kissinger, University of Oxford<br>
Samuel Mimram, Ã‰cole Polytechnique<br>
Simona Paoli, University of Aberdeen<br>
Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, University College London<br>
Pawel Sobocinski, Tallinn University of Technology<br>
Jamie Vicary, University of Cambridge</p>

<p>I'll be talking there (since it's here)!   Looking forward to seeing some folks...</p>

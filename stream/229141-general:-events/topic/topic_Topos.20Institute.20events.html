<p>A message from the Topos Institute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upcoming Events</strong></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://topos.site/topos-colloquium/">2023 colloquium series</a> is now underway, with upcoming speakers including philosopher of mathematics David Corfield, category theorist Christina Vasilakopoulou, mathematical physicist and leading nLab contributor Urs Schreiber, and historian of science Michael Barany. We meet over Zoom at 17:00UTC on Thursdays.</p>
<p>In next week's colloquium (Thursday March 16) we host a <a href="https://topos.site/ct-outreach-self-learners/">panel on Outreach in Category Theory</a>, chaired by Emily Riehl, and featuring Tai-Danae Bradley, Eugenia Cheng, Paul Dancstep, and Oliver Lugg. Ilyas will introduce the session.</p>
<p>We're also <a href="https://topos.site/joa-bookclub/">collaborating with Eugenia to host a book club</a> around her new, brilliant, pedagogical introduction to category theory: The Joy of Abstraction. Each week readers may submit questions about The Joy of Abstraction for Eugenia via an online form, and Eugenia answers via a YouTube video. The book club runs through each chapter in order, from now until July.</p>
<p>We will be hosting a workshop on <a href="https://amcs-community.org/events/cats4consc-workshop/">Category Theory for Consciousness Science</a>, on April 15-16, in Oxford, UK. David Spivak will be presenting, alongside Andr√©e Ehresmann, Bob Coecke, and others. This workshop concludes our grant Categorical Theories of Consciousness: Bridging Neuroscience and Fundamental Physics grant from the Foundational Questions Institute.<br>

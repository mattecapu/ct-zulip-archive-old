<p>Hi everyone, I moved posts about the <a href="http://twitch.tv/binary_operation">Binary Operation Twitch stream</a> to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229141" href="/#narrow/stream/229141-general.3A-events">#general: events</a> from the topic on <a href="#narrow/stream/274877-practice.3A-our-work/topic/Morgan.20Rogers">my work</a>.  We now have a <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@binary_operation">Mastodon account</a> and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/binary2operation/">Instagram account</a>, although we're still deciding how to use both of these; please follow if you're on these platforms!</p>
<p>The next stream will be tomorrow (Sunday) from 9:30am Paris time. We'll be diving deeper into finding out what <strong>asymptotic invariance of the distribution of stuff in the universe</strong> would look like. If that's a strange enough sentence to make you curious, please do drop by... It will be a physics-inspired examination of how symmetry interacts with complexity classes/asymptotic behaviour of functions.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Twitch account (you don't need one to watch, but you would need one to leave a comment during the stream), feel free to send questions either here or through the platforms mentioned above.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the</p>
<p>School on Univalent Mathematics 2022,</p>
<p>to be held at the Palazzone di Cortona<br>
(<a href="https://www.sns.it/en/palazzone-di-cortona">https://www.sns.it/en/palazzone-di-cortona</a>),<br>
Cortona, Italy, July 17-23, 2022<br>
(<a href="https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022/">https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022/</a>)</p>
<p>Overview<br>
========<br>
Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.</p>
<p>The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the computer proof assistant Coq.</p>
<p>In this school, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to the formalization of mathematics in UniMath (<a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath</a>), a library of Univalent Mathematics based on the Coq proof assistant.</p>
<p>Format<br>
=======<br>
Participants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations. In the accompanying problem sessions, they will formalize pieces of univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.</p>
<p>Prerequisites<br>
==========<br>
Participants should be interested in mathematics and the use of computers for mathematical reasoning. Participants do not need to have prior knowledge of logic, Coq, or Univalent Foundations.</p>
<p>Application and funding<br>
=======================<br>
For information on how to participate, please visit <a href="https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022">https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022</a>.<br>
The application deadline is 15 April 2022.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
The organizers Benedikt Ahrens and Marco Maggesi</p>

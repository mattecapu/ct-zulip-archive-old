<p>Abstracts for the first installment ( <time datetime="2022-04-20T13:00:00Z">2022-04-20T14:00:00+01:00</time>)</p>
<p><em>Karvonen</em>, <strong>Inner automorphisms as 2-cells</strong><br>
Abstract: Thinking of groups as one-object categories makes the category of groups naturally into a 2-category. We observe that a similar construction works for any category: a 2-cell f-&gt;g is given by an inner automorphism of the codomain that takes f to g, where inner automomorphisms are defined in general using isotropy groups. We will explore the behavior of limits and colimits in the resulting 2-category: when the underlying category is cocomplete, the resulting 2-category has coequalizers iff the isotropy functor is representable - in the case of groups, this amounts to deducing the existence of HNN-extensions from the representability of id:Grp-&gt;Grp. Under reasonable conditions, limits and connected colimits in the underlying category are 2-categorical limits/colimits in the resulting 2-category. However, many other 2-dimensional limits and colimits fail to exist, unless the underlying category has only trivial inner automorphisms.</p>
<p><em>Lorenzin</em>, <strong>Formality and strongly unique enhancements</strong><br>
Abstract: Inspired by the intrinsic formality of graded algebras, we give a characterization of strongly unique DG-enhancements for a large class of algebraic triangulated categories, linear over a commutative ring. We will discuss applications to bounded derived categories and bounded homotopy categories of complexes. For the sake of an example, the bounded derived category of finitely generated abelian groups has a strongly unique enhancement.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,<br>
The second installment of ItaCa Fest 2022 will take place <time datetime="2022-05-19T13:00:00Z">2022-05-19T14:00:00+01:00</time> <br>
Here's the abstracts for the talks:</p>
<p>Greta Coraglia, <strong>Comonads for dependent types</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In exploring the relation between a classical model of dependent types (comprehension categories) and a new one (judgemental dtts) we pin-point the comonadic behaviour of weakening and contraction. We describe three different 2-categories and show that they are 2-equivalent, then proceed to analyze the benefits of each of the three. The fact that one can precisely relate such different perspectives allows, for example, for a swift and cleaner treatment of type constructors: we show how certain categorical models for dependent types come inherently equipped with some due to the choices one makes in introducing tools to interpret context extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joachim Kock, <strong>Decomposition spaces, right fibrations, and edgewise subdivision</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decomposition spaces are simplicial infinity-groupoids subject to an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition. Where the Segal condition expresses composition, the weak condition expresses decomposition. The motivation for studying decomposition spaces is that they have incidence coalgebras and Möbius inversion. The most important class of simplicial maps for decomposition spaces are the CULF maps (standing for 'conservative' and 'unique-lifting-of-factorisation'), first studied by Lawvere; they induce coalgebra homomorphisms. The theorem I want to arrive at in the talk says that the infinity-category of (Rezk-complete) decomposition spaces and CULF maps is locally an infinity-topos. More precisely for each (Rezk-complete) decomposition space D, the slice infinity-category Decomp/D is equivalent to PrSh(Sd(D)), the infinity-topos of presheaves on the edgewise subdivision of D. Most of the talk will be spent on explaining preliminaries, though.<br>
This is joint work with Philip Hackney.</p>

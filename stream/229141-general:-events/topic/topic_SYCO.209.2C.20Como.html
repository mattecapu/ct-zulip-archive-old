<p>CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS<br>
NINTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 9)</p>
<p>Como, Italy<br>
8-9 September 2022</p>
<p>Submission deadline:  Monday 1 August 2022<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/9/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/9/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language. Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde, Oxford, Chapman, Leicester and Tallinn.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,<br>
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of<br>
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading<br>
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature<br>
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and<br>
junior researchers, including students. Submissions is easy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>
<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions<br>
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in<br>
particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and<br>
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language<br>
processing and machine learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and<br>
reaction networks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,<br>
type theory and game semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal<br>
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and<br>
relationships to homotopy theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation<br>
theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof<br>
assistants, and game theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world<br>
problem descriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES </strong></p>
<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>Submission deadline: Monday 1 August<br>
Author notification: Monday 8 August 2022<br>
Symposium dates: Thursday 8 and Friday 9 September 2022</p>
<p><strong> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS </strong></p>
<p>Submissions are by EasyChair, via the SYCO 9 submission page:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco9">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco9</a></p>
<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.<br>
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even<br>
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively:<br>
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even<br>
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>
<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can<br>
be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose<br>
to <em>defer</em> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject<br>
them. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO<br>
meeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be<br>
prioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held<br>
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>
<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO<br>
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 9; you still<br>
need to submit it again through EasyChair. When submitting, append the<br>
words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X"<br>
with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any<br>
documents.</p>
<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>
<p>The PC chair is John van de Wetering, Radboud University. The Programme Committee will be announced soon.</p>

<p>The meeting will have an online component and all talks will be broadcast on Zoom. Registered online participants will be contacted by e-mail, closer to the meeting date, with the virtual coordinates.</p>

<p>The usual rule for SYCO is to avoid online talks but to allow online participation, so we will try to broadcast or record the talks. Of course, we are aware of the uncertainties related to covid and we are ready to adapt if necessary.</p>

<p>Hmm, this passage I quoted from the web page seems to have been deleted now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meeting will have an online component and all talks will be broadcast on Zoom. Registered online participants will be contacted by e-mail, closer to the meeting date, with the virtual coordinates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I submitted a talk because I thought this meant I could give a talk virtually.   But I guess that's false!   So I'll have to withdraw my talk.</p>

<p>Due to the climate crisis, we need to stop flying around to conferences.... at least until they develop airplanes that don't run on fossil fuels.    We can have local conferences, that's good, and maybe that's what SYCO aims to be - but there are also reasons for people who are geographically far apart to communicate verbally, not just write and read papers.  So, we need to get good at conferences where we give talks and even do some of the social part online.  </p>
<p>The pandemic was a powerful nudge in the right direction: hybrid conferences.   It would be sad to see this progress lost.</p>
<p>Anyway, if SYCO9 is not hybrid, I will have to withdraw my talk.</p>

<p>In part I agree. On the other hand being able to travel around is one of the few perks of working in academia.  This, and the freedom in pursuing one's research interests. These two things have been constantly eroded away year after year, because of the pandemic and the climate crisis the former, because of the increasing amount of admin work put on faculty the latter. So, given this, why should one even stay in academia? I understand how "we have to fly less" makes a lot of sense rationally and ideologically, but the practical consequence of this will be, imho, nudging even more people towards the corporate environment.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm not saying changes in individual behavior are the most important way to cut carbon emissions.  But it's part of changing the culture.   Treating carbon emissions as an attractive perk, rather than something embarrassing, has got to go.</p>

<p>CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS<br>
NINTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 9)</p>
<p>Como, Italy<br>
8-9 September 2022</p>
<p>Submission deadline:  Monday 1 August 2022<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/9/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/9/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language. Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde, Oxford, Chapman, Leicester and Tallinn.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,<br>
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of<br>
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading<br>
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature<br>
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and<br>
junior researchers, including students. Submissions is easy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>
<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions<br>
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in<br>
particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and<br>
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language<br>
processing and machine learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and<br>
reaction networks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,<br>
type theory and game semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal<br>
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and<br>
relationships to homotopy theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation<br>
theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof<br>
assistants, and game theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world<br>
problem descriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES </strong></p>
<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>Submission deadline: Monday 1 August<br>
Author notification: Monday 8 August 2022<br>
Symposium dates: Thursday 8 and Friday 9 September 2022</p>
<p><strong> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS </strong></p>
<p>Submissions are by EasyChair, via the SYCO 9 submission page:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco9">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco9</a></p>
<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.<br>
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even<br>
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively:<br>
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even<br>
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>
<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can<br>
be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose<br>
to <em>defer</em> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject<br>
them. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO<br>
meeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be<br>
prioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held<br>
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>
<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO<br>
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 9; you still<br>
need to submit it again through EasyChair. When submitting, append the<br>
words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X"<br>
with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any<br>
documents.</p>
<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>
<p>The PC chair is John van de Wetering, Radboud University. The Programme Committee will be announced soon.</p>
<p><strong> STEERING COMMITTEE </strong></p>
<p>Ross Duncan, University of Strathclyde<br>
Chris Heunen, University of Edinburgh<br>
Dominic Horsman, University of Oxford<br>
Aleks Kissinger, University of Oxford<br>

<p>Hi! Looking forward to everything getting going tomorrow!</p>
<p>What are the logistics for presenting? If we want to show slides do we need to bring a device to plug into a projector? Or will there be a computer set up that we can send a copy of our slides to?</p>

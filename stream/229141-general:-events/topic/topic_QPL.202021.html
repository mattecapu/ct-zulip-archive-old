<p>Hi all, the deadline for <a href="https://qpl2021.eu/">*Quantum Physics and Logic*</a> is coming up in a month. The conference has always been very friendly towards categorical methods used to understand quantum theory better, so consider submitting something there. They accept both 12 page proceedings, as well as 3 page extended abstracts of results published elsewhere. See Call for Papers below.</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>QPL is an annual conference that brings together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas, with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields (including computer science) is also welcome.</p>
<p>QPL 2021 will be held both virtually online and physically in Gdansk (COVID permitting).</p>

<p>Non-proceedings submissions consist of a 3 page extended abstract and a link to a separate published paper, pre-print, or an attached draft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poster submissions consist of a 1-3 page abstract and may contain a link to a separate published paper or pre-print. Submission of partial results of work in progress is encouraged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done via EasyChair: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2021">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2021</a></p>
<p>BEST STUDENT PAPER</p>

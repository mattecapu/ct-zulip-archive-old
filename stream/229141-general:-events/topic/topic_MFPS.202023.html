<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>We will be posting MFPS call for paper soon, and I thought I'll advertise here too. MFPS 2023 is colocated with CALCO, it will take place at Indiana University Bloomington on June 20-23. It is centered around the semantics of programming language and it is a good fit for categorical papers. </p>
<p>Abstract Submission is March 24,  Paper Submission is March 31, 2023. <br>
More details on the PC and invited speakers can be found here :</p>

<p>Note that MFPS will happen just before LICS, and that both conferences are located in the US, making it possible to participate to LICS workshops and conference after going to MFPS/CALCO.</p>

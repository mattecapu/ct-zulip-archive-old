<p>Professor Baez,</p>
<p>Hope you had a happy thanksgiving!  In the new year, I am piloting that bootcamp I mentioned to prepare soon-to-be grads in STEM fields for careers in software.  Here's the info, and feel free to circulate at UCR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a ~10 week "bootcamp" to help graduating college &amp; grad students in STEM fields prepare for careers in the software industry.  The core is a 10 week course to teach you how to build and deploy web apps, and along the way you'll learn general principles for building real-world software products. During/after the course, we will provide ongoing career mentorship to help you get the job you want, from joining one of the biggest tech companies in the world to getting your own start-up off the ground.</p>

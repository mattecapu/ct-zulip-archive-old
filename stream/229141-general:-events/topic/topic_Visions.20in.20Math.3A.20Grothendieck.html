<blockquote>
<p>The colloquium “Visions in mathematics: from Grothendieck to the present day” will be held on Wednesday 14 June 2023 at the Amphithéâtre Hermite of the Institut Henri Poincaré, 11 Rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 75005 Paris, from 6 pm to 8 pm, with the participation of Olivia Caramello, Mateo Carmona, Alain Connes, Stéphane Dugowson, Johanna Grothendieck and Laurent Lafforgue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Guided by a concern to build connections between the dimensions at stake, a round table discussion will allow the speakers to freely address the questions raised for them by the person and visionary work of Alexandre Grothendieck (1928-2014), from a philosophical, historical, literary and political perspective, as well as on more specifically mathematical themes, whether it be the future of topos theory in today’s mathematical landscape, relations with academic institutions in pure and applied mathematics, industrial research, teaching or the dissemination of scientific knowledge. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The discussion will then open up to the audience. The final hour of the afternoon will be devoted to a cocktail dinner offered by the Grothendieck Institute, providing a convivial opportunity to continue the conversations initiated by the round table and to take advantage of useful networking opportunities.</p>

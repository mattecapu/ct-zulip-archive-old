<p>I've just been advertising the deadlines for the LICS 2023 conference (Logic In Computer Science) and I thought to mention them here too. <br>
The abstracts/papers are due 18/23 Jan 2023. There's also a call for workshop proposals, deadline 30 November. </p>
<p>There are several people from this Zulip on the LICS programme committee, and it seems a good venue for applied category theory, although LICS is more general than that. </p>

<p>It's not very important but I think the topics in LICS are both more <em>and less</em> general than applied category theory: i.e., they overlap but neither is a subset of the other.</p>

<p>Sorry yes, you're quite right. Although having said that, there actually aren't many talks at ACT 2022 that seem totally off topic for LICS. I think if anyone wants to submit a paper, and is using techniques that are relevant to LICS (e.g. category theory), then that might be ok topic-wise. It's up to the programme committee I guess.</p>

<p>I submitted to LICS a few years ago and my experience was extremely discouraging. I got a +3 review, but also a -2 review, the substance of which was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper is very well written, the results are clearly outlined, and these appear to be interesting results for category theorists. This said, I do not quite see what the connection to computer science is or could possibly be, and I wish the authors had made some attempt in the introduction to connect this work to some part of CS; there is a short paragraph in which the authors speculate about a possible connection to relational databases, but the link appears tenuous at best; the conclusion does not help much either as it states various possible future avenues of research in category theory. I find it difficult to recommend acceptance under the circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think I'll be submitting any more theoretical work to LICS. Prestigious or not, it feels like a waste of time.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you experienced this. I think it's bad for everybody if newcomers get discouraged like that. I'm actually on the steering committee, and I agree this can sometimes be a problem, and we're looking into some new initiatives for avoiding this right now. Happy to also hear any suggestions. There are several ACT people on the PC this year, so maybe things would be better this year from that perspective.  </p>
<p>For anyone, I'm happy to have a look at a draft in advance if you are worried about getting these kinds of reviews from a non-expert, in case that might help (not that I'm claiming to be magic in any way!).</p>

<p>I tentatively suggest making all reviews (for rejected and accepted papers) public information. They could still be anonymous, but I think there's at least some chance that knowing your review will be publicly available would make it uncomfortable to write lazy or uncharitable reviews, which would reflect poorly on the venue.</p>

<p>Let me nitpick on words: there is basically no Theory A in LICS.  That's the stuff of STOC, FOCS, SODA...  The difference is that at a Theory B conference, you will find some people who dislike category theory; at an actual Theory A conference, you won't, because people there hardly ever heard the word "category" in their life <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span></p>
<p>About the feeling that it is a lottery: yes, the whole TCS conference system is.  It's <em>very</em> bad, and in my opinion it should be substantially reformed.  I don't want to start a discussion now, I just want to stress that it's by no means a specific problem of LICS, or of category theorists submitting to TCS conferences.</p>
<p>So, for categorically-minded computer scientists, you shouldn't feel discouraged to submit to LICS any more than to any other TCS/Theory B conference.  In fact, depending on the PC, it is quite the contrary.  For example, my impression this year is that the lottery is not negatively biased towards category theory (not to say positively...).</p>

<p>Personally, I would be 100% in favor of this.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure it will be easily accepted by a majority of people.  (In any case, I'm not on the LICS SC, so I have no saying specifically).</p>
<p>As I said above, I think that the TCS conference system needs a substantial reform.  I am hopeful that it will happen at some point, maybe very gradually, although for the moment (and, in fact, for the past 15/20 years, at least) we're still at the stage where nearly everyone agrees that change is needed, but almost nothing changes, probably because agreeing on <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> to change is more difficult...</p>

<p>Thanks for the discussions and the suggestion about open reviews. Do you mean like ICLR, with public accept and reject reviews? <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference">https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference</a><br>
If so I'll bring the idea up when we next discuss it. <br>
I'd also like to read more about the theory of it or the success data of it, if anyone has any references. </p>
<p>(I will admit, I had recently been really nervous about submitting to a workshop that proposed to make reviews public, anonymously. What if someone says something grumpy about my work, or misses the point, or judges me against the wrong criteria, or damns me with faint praise. Then it would follow me round, other people might jump to conclusions, even if the paper was accepted. I can see some of that happening in the ICLR reviews. However I take your point that maybe chairs would have some incentive to say "don't say that please, it's embarrassing for the conference".)</p>

<p>Yes, that would be one "half" of LICS papers.   But the point is that automata are Theory B, not Theory A.  Theory A would be "we improve by 0.00357 the constant of this randomized algorithm for deciding some problem on graphs" or "this quantum complexity class with this oracle contains this other circuit complexity class" or "a new variant of some algorithm for some version of public key cryptography", etc.  Check out the list of <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2022/accepted-papers.html">accepted papers at the last STOC</a> for a better idea.  You will not find a single occurrence of the word "automata" in the titles of the papers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the discussions and the suggestion about open reviews. Do you mean like ICLR, with public accept and reject reviews? <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference">https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference</a><br>
If so I'll bring the idea up when we next discuss it. <br>
I'd also like to read more about the theory of it or the success data of it, if anyone has any references. </p>
<p>(I will admit, I had recently been really nervous about submitting to a workshop that proposed to make reviews public, anonymously. What if someone says something grumpy about my work, or misses the point, or judges me against the wrong criteria, or damns me with faint praise. Then it would follow me round, other people might jump to conclusions, even if the paper was accepted. I can see some of that happening in the ICLR reviews. However I take your point that maybe chairs would have some incentive to say "don't say that please, it's embarrassing for the conference".)</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly how OpenReview works, but something like this, yes.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense to publish the list of submitted papers together with their reviews and any responses, separately from the main list of papers accepted for presentation.</p>
<p>If one of your reviewers misses the point, you can explain this in your response. I imagine having all this be public would give reviewers an incentive to <em>consider your response</em>, which there isn't really now. It's just more work.</p>
<p>I think this is actually more useful to have for accepted papers. Good reviews are useful to everyone.</p>

<p>This could also be a pathway to getting some sort of credit (in the way that we get credit for publishing papers) for writing good reviews. Reviewing papers well is a ton of work, and more or less a thankless task. If taking the time to review a paper well "counts" as formal academic output somehow, I would guess that the overall quality of reviews would improve.</p>

<p>... I have no idea where we would find data on any of this.</p>

<p>A final thought is that if all submissions are published, it might disincentivize submitting poor quality work in bad faith, and hoping that it slips through the review process. Maybe this one is just wishful thinking though.</p>

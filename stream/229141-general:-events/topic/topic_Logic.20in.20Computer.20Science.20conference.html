<p>I've just been advertising the deadlines for the LICS 2023 conference (Logic In Computer Science) and I thought to mention them here too. <br>
The abstracts/papers are due 18/23 Jan 2023. There's also a call for workshop proposals, deadline 30 November. </p>
<p>There are several people from this Zulip on the LICS programme committee, and it seems a good venue for applied category theory, although LICS is more general than that. </p>

<p>(Is there a separate stream for conference adverts etc? Sorry if so.)</p>

<p>It's not very important but I think the topics in LICS are both more <em>and less</em> general than applied category theory: i.e., they overlap but neither is a subset of the other.</p>

<p>Sorry yes, you're quite right. Although having said that, there actually aren't many talks at ACT 2022 that seem totally off topic for LICS. I think if anyone wants to submit a paper, and is using techniques that are relevant to LICS (e.g. category theory), then that might be ok topic-wise. It's up to the programme committee I guess.</p>

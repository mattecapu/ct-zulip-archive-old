<p>Thereâ€™s a study called <em>generalized primes</em> which investigates in a more general way the relationship between arbitrary elements called <em>primes</em> and the <em>composites</em> which can be formed from them according to specified rules of composition.&nbsp; Comparisons can be made among a variety of numerical systems or any orders of combinatorial species one might imagine.&nbsp; I seem to recall at least one old monograph by Rademacher on the subject.</p>
<p>My fascination with questions like that led me many years ago to the Riff&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rote trick, a&nbsp;special case of the Make&nbsp;A&nbsp;Picture trick.&nbsp; There's a bit on that in the following article.</p>

<p>The interaction between addition and multiplication in the natural numbers has long been an interest of mine, leading to broader questions about the relationship between algebra and combinatorics.&nbsp; My gropings with those enigmas led me to the structures of Riffs&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rotes, extracting what we might think of as the &ldquo;purely combinatorial&rdquo; properties of primes factorizations.&nbsp; Thinking of the additive structure of the positive integers as embodied in their total linear ordering, the following two questions arise.</p>
<ul>
<li>How much of the natural ordering of the natural numbers is purely combinatorial?</li>
<li>What additional axioms on the partial orders of Riffs and Rotes would restore their natural order?</li>
</ul>

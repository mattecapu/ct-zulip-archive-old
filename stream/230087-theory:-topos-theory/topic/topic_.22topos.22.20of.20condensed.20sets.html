<p>Why is it tautological?  There's a theorem to prove about how the Giraud axioms imply left-exactness of the reflector.</p>

<p>There's something unsatisfactory about using the pretopos itself as the site. Here's how I think about it. Given a site (C, J),  we have the category of small presheaves on C and the category of small J-sheaves on C; assuming J is subcanonical, we get a colimit-preserving functor from presheaves to sheaves. Is it always a localisation? Does it always have a right adjoint? I know there are combinatorial hypotheses that ensure the functor is lex.</p>

<p>I don't think it always has a right adjoint, but I think it should always be a coinverter; this is more or less the conclusion of section 8 of <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/27/7/27-07abs.html">Exact completions and small sheaves</a>.  I don't see what's unsatisfactory about it; if the category doesn't have a small generating set, then there's no reason there would be any other possibility, and in any case the pretopos itself is certainly a more canonical choice of site than anything smaller.</p>

<p>Choosing the pretopos itself as the site makes the existence of the right adjoint almost tautological, however. It would be much more interesting if there were a combinatorial condition on (C, J) ensuring that small J-sheaves on C are also small presheaves on C.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, I agree about the right adjoint being easier in that case.  But I would regard that as a good thing, since in the situation we're trying to generalize (toposes) the right adjoint also exists for trivial reasons.  Sure, it would also be interesting to have a combinatorial condition as you suggest, but that would be icing on the cake.  (-:</p>

<p>many thanks for the reference (sorry for offtopic). it made me laughing first time after last ten days of shellings and other circumstances.</p>

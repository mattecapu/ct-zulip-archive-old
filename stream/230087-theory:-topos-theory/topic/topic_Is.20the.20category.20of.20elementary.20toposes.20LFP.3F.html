<p>I don't know if this counts as a basic question, but I can't find anything in the literature and I don't see an appropriate existing thread. Perhaps someone here knows!</p>
<p>Q: Is the category of elementary toposes and logical morphisms known to be locally finitely presentable?</p>

<p>(realizing this is probably one of those "this depends..." questions, let's start with toposes internal to Set, or similar)</p>

<p>I think it is. The category of elementary toposes and logical morphisms is the category of algebras for a finitary monad on Cat (this is shown in Dubacâ€“Kelly's <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82757533.pdf">A Presentation of Topoi as Algebraic Relative to Categories of Graphs</a>), and the category of algebras for a finitary monad on a locally finitely presentable category is also locally finitely presentable by the final remark of Chapter 2 of <em>Locally Presentable and Accessible Categories</em> (page 124).</p>

<p>Thanks! I think that answers my question :)</p>

<p>It depends <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span><br>
Let's consider a simpler question: is the category of (categories with a terminal object) and (functors preserving the terminal object) lfp?<br>
If one interprets the question as being about categories with a <em>chosen</em> terminal object and functors which <em>strictly</em> (i.e., up to equality) preserve the chosen terminal object, then the answer is yes, by the above sort of argument. In fact, Freyd's "Aspects of topoi" more or less explicitly describes a finitary essentially algebraic theory of which elementary topoi in this sense (i.e., with chosen terminal object / pullbacks / subobject classifier or whatever the exact list) are the models.<br>
If one interprets the question in the more usual way as about categories with at least one terminal object and functors which preserve the property of being a terminal object, and if one is interested in the 1-category of such categories and functors, then the answer is no. In fact there is not even an initial category-with-terminal-object, because if we pick a category with at least two terminal objects, there cannot be exactly one terminal-object-preserving functor from any category-with-terminal-object to it.<br>
If however one considers the question to be about 2-categories or (2,1)-categories, then presumably the answer is yes again but one has to first understand what is meant by "locally finitely presentable 2-category".</p>

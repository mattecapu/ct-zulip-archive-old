<p>Sebastiano Vigna's <em>A Guided Tour in the Topos of Graphs</em> is a nice read, but topos theory is too vast to study it all in this context in a single paper. I wonder if anyone has considered this topos as a classifying topos? I have a nice description of the theory classified by this topos in mind, which I could express as a sketch, but I'm curious if anyone has put any effort into expressing/interpreting a theory classified by this topos before me.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lawvere? Although one must be careful to distinguish between the reflexive and non-reflexive cases.</p>

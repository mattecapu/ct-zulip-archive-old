<p>There is a new journal about philosophy of mathematics: <a href="https://mxphi.com">Annals of Mathematics and Philosophy</a>.  So I want to advertise it in case you're interested by the subject and if you didn't notice. The first issue is available in open access here: <a href="https://mxphi.com/first-issue/">Volume 1, number 1, 2023</a>. Every single paper looks passionating, I think I'm going to read all of them! For example, three of them are titled "What makes mathematicians believe unproved mathematical statements?" by Timothy Gowers, a paper "Ways of thinking in mathematics" (Javier de Lorenzo), "What is axiomatics?" (Paolo Cant√π). There is an interview of Penrose also and the other ones are attracting to me too.</p>

<p>Has anyone read Alain Badiou's work <a href="http://www.elimeyerhoff.com/books/Badiou/Badiou-Being_and_Event_Searchable.pdf">being and event</a>? I seem to have a similar view of the world, however I consider myself mathematics first, philosophy second (or third, after physics). </p>
<p>His thesis is that ontology = mathematics. I'm unsure exactly how he sees ontology, it seems somewhere in between Heidegger and Spivak. I lean heavily towards Spivak, i.e. that categories are ontologies (<a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/olog.pdf">ologs</a>). In my view, <em>any</em> structured collection of things form an ontology. So categories, but also spaces, groups, sSets, etc. In this sense, I naively agree with the notion that "mathematics = ontology". Again, I'm not actually sure this is how Badiou sees ontology, and to be perfectly transparent I have not yet finished the book.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the goal of HoTT, and other modern foundations, is to ontologize mathematics: Turning the nebulous "proof statements" of math, into <em>things</em> (objects, like spaces) inside of ontologies (higher/formal categories). </p>
<p>In this sense, would you agree or disagree with the statement that "Ontology = Mathematics" or even "Ontology <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>≃</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\simeq</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4637em;"></span><span class="mrel">≃</span></span></span></span> Mathematics"?</p>

<p>I like Badiou but I haven’t finished Being and Event. I somewhat disagree with the association he makes: I assume ontology and epistemology (ways of knowing) are equal, something which I’m not quite ready to divorce from mathematics.</p>
<p>I don’t place philosophy second to mathematics. I think rather they are “dual” ways of thinking and explaining that are forced to be separate by historical and material processes (the different priorities of societies in which each developed, changing ways of organizing knowledge, the priorities and organization of the academy)</p>

<p>ultimately i think Badiou is making an effort into mathematics not many other philosophers else did and should be encouraged, but i was confused after my first pass at his formalism. i think he has something to say, and then looks to mathematics to say it, rather than examine the differences between both ways of explanation. from what I remember, this is capital-F Formalism: using formal expression to replace the content of your argument. </p>
<p>a caveat: a lot of this is based off of my memory from when i wanted to take a critical look from a mathematical and philosophical point of view.</p>

<p>I recognize formalism has handy for, as you say, identifying structure in certain statements, but I recognize capital-F Formalism as an error: for me, it means an over-valuation of formal presentation. I think that’s why a lot of mathematicians reading Badiou find it somewhat distasteful.  some philosophers (Lacan, e.g,) have had a tendency to be formalistic in this way.</p>

<p>Okay good, it's yet to be settled for me as well. </p>
<p>It seems from my perspective that Philosophy has a bad taste for "Formalism" because past formalisms usually meant tons of error and hence loss of human life. Maybe in the future, our models will accommodate for all the small complexities. Maybe even those that govern the mind. </p>

<p>I read some of Badiou's later stuff, where he incorporates elements of topos theory, years ago during my Masters. I was very critical of it, not just for the Formalism problem <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275940">@Matt Cuffaro (he/him)</span> describes but because he imports concepts from topos theory as-is, without due consideration for whether they are appropriate. That is, he talks about why the ingredients of topos theory are important for his philosophical development without properly addressing how they're relevant.</p>

<p>I hear you but I think that’s precisely the consequence with a “Formalist error:” not critically evaluating _why_ such a connection is relevant. It’s part of an intellectual disconnection between “Mathematics” and “Philosophy” where the latter seeks the rigor of the first through formal argument without carving a path to it first, but instead jumping over to it</p>

<p>I do the same thing when I am out of my natural field. For example, I'm not very well versed in the philosophy views on ontology so I cite people like Heidegger without <em>really</em> knowing.  Though I should mention I have been thinking about ologs for a long time. </p>
<p>I know what you mean though, about arbitrary choice of structure. He can do better but may need help from ct people. CT does it too; I love virtual double categories, yet it is not the perfect "synthetic" structure to describe many ideas.  vdcs help to frame the yet-to-be-discovered, more expressive structures. I think if I am groping for higher math to help me, he should be able to do it too, to an extent. e.g. he shouldn't be able to print mis-information.</p>
<p>Anyway,  in my view, the notion of "choice of structure" needs to be taken seriously in a good theory of ontology.</p>

<p>I will take issue with your claim that proof statements were nebulous prior to homotopy type theory. I don't know what you had in mind when you wrote that, but presumably you did not mean the concept of formal proof, which has been around for at least a hundred years.</p>

<p>If I take set theory as my foundation, and formalize the concept of proof as a syntax tree in a certain formal system, where the concept of "tree" and "well-formed formula" are defined internally to set theory, perhaps using the hereditarily finite sets, I have certainly turned my proof into a "thing" inside of an "ontology" (or, I would say, semantics)</p>

<p>Patrick, thank you for your ideas. I do see set theory as a theory of ontology, for me "an ontology" is a structured collection of things. Sets carry structure, so do syntax trees, groupoids, and spaces. By "nebulous proof" I refer to a proof that isn't <em>explicitly</em> stated as an entity of an ontology. For example proof <em>in</em> HoTT is interpreted as an element of a path space. "nebulous" is not meant as pejorative, it refers to its lack of an explicit ontology whose structure interprets the proof. </p>
<p>One could go back and retrace the steps of older proofs and translate them into entities of some ontology (paths in spaces), like some people in HoTT do, but that translation is done using a <em>choice</em> of foundations. If I go and retrace the steps in one version of HoTT v.s. another, I may get two different paths for a proof, one may not even exist, and the two may not even be isomorphic in any sense. e.g. if one includes a law of excluded middle, but the other does not. </p>
<p>When I say "nebulous" I don't mean a proof is not rigorous, I mean that it has no ontology to live in. HoTT, and the other modern type theories, will state explicitly what ontology, or structured collection of things, a proof lives in.</p>

<p>I have a lot to say about this. First, what is "an ontology"? I don't mean what sorts of things do you point to and label "ontology" (in this case "a structured collection of things"). I mean what kind of role would you want the concept of "an ontology" to play? And second, why should the sort of mathematical objects you point to be identified as 'ontologies'? To me, it seems like a weird way of talking, but maybe that's just my analytic philosopher brain. </p>
<p>It's weird to me because the concept of 'ontology' is already loaded (many people have different ideas of what that word means) and confusing (I often don't understand the answers people, like Badiou, give to what the word means). And pointing to a mathematical structure doesn't really elucidate things for me. </p>
<p>Third, I just don't think HoTT is unique here. Any time we do proof theory we study proofs as objects in their own right, as Patrick pointed out with proof trees. As another example: to prove Gödel's incompleteness theorems, you need to treat proofs as statements of arithmetic. </p>
<p>And finally, re: Badiou in general, I'd say be very careful to take his analysis or explication of mathematics as sacrosanct. My impression is that his style of philosophy can be rather loose and even sloppy, which is not something I think is desirable in philosophy of mathematics.</p>

<p>After reading your message I am thinking that what you're calling "ontologizing mathematics" is what I would call "providing semantics for proofs". From this perspective what you're saying makes sense to me. HoTT has an interesting semantics for proofs, whereas ZFC does not have a really interesting semantics for proofs besides the tautological one (a proof is a well formed syntax tree). Old school intuitionism has a nebulous proof semantics - a proof is a mental construction, a proof is a piece of evidence that witnesses the validity of a proposition. Modern constructive type theories allow us to make the old school intuitionist proof semantics more precise/rigorous.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm missing something here, but maybe you can clarify how your concept of ontologizing mathematics ties into the research program of proof-theoretic semantics? To take a simple example, Girard's notion of coherence spaces. Is this an ontologization of linear logic?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of role would you want the concept of "an ontology" to play? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ontology should behave like both a meta-theory and a theory. I think many people have written about this as n-theories, where the n+1-theory is seen as a sort of "doctrine" for the kinds of n-theories within it.  An ontology, as a structured collection of things, reasons about its entities using its structure. For example, a LCCC provides the structure for expressing dependent products and sums. In this sense, the category of LCCCs is an ontology (like a 2-theory), a specific LCCC is an ontology (like a 1-theory), and ostensibly the objects of an LCCC are ontologies, though this requires extra work.   As a more simple example: a group is an ontology, the monoidal category of groups is an ontology, the 2-category of monoidal categories is an ontology, and so on. Ontologies all the way down. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>second, why should the sort of mathematical objects you point to be identified as 'ontologies'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, any mathematical object should be considered as an ontology. If in philosophy "ontology" means a theory of existence, "an ontology", as I have defined it, is a collection of things that exist. For example, an element of a group exists within the group itself.

<p>I came across this very interesting talk by Iain McGilchrist on "The Coincidence of Opposites"<br>

which is just fabulous in it's breadth from pshychology to brain science to poetry and arts.</p>

<p>That should raise one's interest in his new 2 Volumes book "The Matter with Things" <br>

<p>I have not seen him mention or refer to Category Theory yet (but I am just discovering this work), and it would not be surprising if he had not had the time or inclination to look that way. To ask someone to have such deep knowledge of the humanities, psychology and brain sciences and also Category Theory at this stage would at this point in history still be to ask a lot.  I guess he would be fascinated by the Yoneda lemma and work by Maruyama if he were pointed to it, and helped to get his head around it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1466543393178206209">https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1466543393178206209</a></p>

does not look at in the talk "The Coincidence of Opposites" is Mathematics. Were he to look that way he would find duality right in its fabric. That is covered by Maruyama in his thesis "Meaning and Duality"

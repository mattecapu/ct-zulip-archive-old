<p>I'm starting a topic to invite people, especially those who have stable jobs by now, to share some of their successful early-career grant applications, in particular those for “regular” schemes like EPSRC, Marie Curie, etc. </p>
<p>I think that many early career people here (including me) would benefit from more examples from our own field; I have certainly got good ideas (in terms of structure, etc. -- not scientific content, of course!) whenever somebody with more experience has been willing to share one of theirs.</p>
<p>Since I don't want to look like I'm just asking others and not contributing, here's my own application material that got me a <a href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/">JSPS postdoctoral fellowship</a> before I completed my phd in 2017. <br>
(This was quite brief compared to what is required for other grants -- just a 2-page project, CV, and a few lines on past and present research to fill into an online form.) <a href="/user_uploads/21317/Zt9deKrH_GbL3EiRq5KmN-HL/jsps_application.zip">jsps_application.zip</a></p>

<p>This is a great idea Amar! Thanks for starting this! </p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of writing up applicaitons for postdoctoral fellowships. So if anyone has any successful EPSRC or Marie Curie (specifically in the maths) applications they can share, I would be super grateful!</p>

<p>Here's another shot in the dark: does anyone have a successful NSERC postdoc fellowship they would be to share with me?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>This is to give you advance warning that in the new year we will be<br>
advertising a permanent position here at Macquarie University in Sydney.</p>
<p>While the position will be open to any field of mathematics, priority<br>
will be given to excellent candidates working in category theory. As<br>
many of you are probably aware, the group here is pretty active: we have<br>
Steve Lack and myself as continuing academics, Ross Street, Dominic<br>
Verity and Mike Johnson as emeritus professors, and John Power as an<br>
honorary professor; plus a community of 11 postgraduate students and a<br>
couple of postdocs.</p>
<p>This is a Lecturer position, analogous to a UK lecturer or a US<br>
assistant professor, with a base salary of AU$110,000-$130,000, and is a<br>
balanced academic role with 40% research, 40% teaching and 20% service.<br>
We expect the formal advertisement to be live at the start of February<br>
with a closing date early in March. This rather short period is forced<br>
upon us by federal government rules, so it seems best to get word out<br>
now.</p>
<p>Please feel free to distribute this message further, and don't hesitate<br>
to get in touch if you have any questions about anything to do with<br>
this.</p>
<p>Richard<br>
</p>

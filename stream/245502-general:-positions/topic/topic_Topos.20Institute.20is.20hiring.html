<p>I'm afraid this is a real job where you gotta really work, not a research position.     Brendan Fong writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Topos is hiring! We're looking for an operations assistant to assist across the organization with office management, bookkeeping, grant administration, coordination with donors, and so on. It'll be full-time, and will eventually require regular in-office work in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who might be interested, or how to reach potentially interested parties based in Berkeley or nearby? We've advertised an entry-level-ish position, but would also be open to creating a more senior position for the right candidate. We're hoping for someone with whom our mission of shaping tech for public benefit really resonates, even if it's not a technical/scientific role itself.</p>
<p>Here's the position description: <a href="https://topos.site/topos_operations_assistant.pdf">https://topos.site/topos_operations_assistant.pdf</a><br>

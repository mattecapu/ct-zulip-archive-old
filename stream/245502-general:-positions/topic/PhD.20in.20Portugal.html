<p><a href="https://alfa.di.uminho.pt/~nevrenato/">Renato Neves of the University of Minho</a>, Portugal is advertising a PhD position in applied category theory.</p>
<p>Applications are due <strong>December 22, 2021</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We [2] have available a PhD studentship on the topic of quantitative<br>
semantics for hybrid programming [1].</p>
<p>The position will involve (extensions of) lambda-calculus and category<br>
theory. We will also work with bits and pieces of topology and<br>
probability theory. But don't worry if you're unfamiliar with some of<br>
these topics -- most important is that you're eager to learn!</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting date</li>
</ul>
<p>The starting date is preferably 1st April 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li>Context</li>
</ul>
<p>This position is part of a broader research project that involves<br>
several researchers across different institutions in the north of<br>
Portugal. The overarching goal is to establish mathematical<br>
foundations for a discipline of hybrid programming capable of<br>
handling noise and uncertainty in a principled, rigorous way.</p>
<p>In case you're not familiar with the concept, a hybrid program combines<br>
classical program constructs with differential equations to model, among<br>
other things, interactions between digital devices and physical<br>
processes (such as velocity, movement, and energy). Examples of hybrid<br>
programs can be found in [1,6] and in my webpage.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to apply</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send me an email no later than 22nd December 2021 with<br>
the following two items:</p>
<p>+ a cover letter;<br>
  + a detailed CV.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile if you have any questions about the position,<br>
including living in Portugal, please do not hesitate to contact me!<br>
Btw, Portugal is known as one of the safest countries in the world<br>
[3]; has lots of sunshine, pristine beaches, and great food [4,5].</p>

<p>Hi all. I have a colleague who is looking to hire a research scientist with experience in semantic modeling (knowledge graphs, ontologies) and related areas of natural language processing. The employer is also open to category theory, although not deeply involved themselves.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has a background in these areas and might be interested, send me a private message and I can pass on your information. Thanks!</p>

<p>Following up on my previous post, this would be an implementation-oriented position. If your (friend's) CV/resume/website doesn't prominently display programming expertise and experience, please include that as well. Also useful would be any prior experience working with graph databases, RDF/OWL or semantic analysis in NLP (e.g., word2vec, DisCoCat).</p>

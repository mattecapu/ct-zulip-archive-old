<p>Hope this finds you well.  We have an unexpected vacancy in our department and are looking for someone who can fill in next year. I've been given permission to recommend a candidate to the Dean without doing a full search, so if  you know of anyone who could use a position for next year, please have them get in touch with me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This would be a 1-year visiting assistant professorship, though it's possible that we'll be advertising a tenure-track position next year. We can be somewhat flexible about teaching assignments, but it's likely to involve a mix of introductory statistics, calculus, and/or introductory CS (our introductory coding class, maybe data structures), depending on background. The minimum requirement is an MA; a PhD is of course better, but a student who needs an extra year to finish would be fine. Unfortunately, they need to be legal to work in the US without sponsorship.</p>
<p>Thanks, and <br>
Best,<br>
Alex</p>

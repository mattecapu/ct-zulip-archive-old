<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a PhD student working with semantic web technologies and their application to the cyber-physical domain to make communication between machines more intelligent (mainly, having less point-to-point connections coded by hand). Right now I am learning bisimulation and coinduction by going through (Sangiorgi 2011) on my own in order to study the properties of federated rule execution, but feel that I need some help to get through the book. </p>
<p>I am looking for paid private tutoring online or in person (if you are in Stockholm and not going away after midsommar), approx 2-4 h/week. Please PM me if you are available.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Andrew</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
Just to let you know that the position is still open, with the "new" advert being here <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs181.php">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs181.php</a> and the last possible starting date being July 1st. Once again, there are words there about some topics, but happy to discuss whatever thing I might be able to usefully supervise.<br>
Unfortunately, I believe the dreadful UKRI quota on international applicants has long been reached, so only UK applicants are eligible now :/</p>

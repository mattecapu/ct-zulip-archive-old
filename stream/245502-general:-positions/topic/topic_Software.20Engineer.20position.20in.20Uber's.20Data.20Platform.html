<p>The Data Schema team at Uber is looking for a strong hands-on engineer; see the job listing at <a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/careers/list/61853">https://www.uber.com/global/en/careers/list/61853</a>. This team develops and maintains the infrastructure for our 300k+ dataset and Kafka topic schemas. I think the position may appeal to members of this channel, as our schemas are essentially a huge collection of algebraic data types. The data model for our standardized schemas was formalized in terms of category theory, and the software we use for many of our schema transformations is written in Haskell (see <a href="https://eng.uber.com/dragon-schema-integration-at-uber-scale">https://eng.uber.com/dragon-schema-integration-at-uber-scale</a>). The currently offered position is focused on infrastructure development in Java and Go, although there will be opportunities to contribute to the Haskell code base if that is what you are interested in. Contact me at <a href="mailto:joshsh@uber.com">joshsh@uber.com</a> or  apply through the website.</p>

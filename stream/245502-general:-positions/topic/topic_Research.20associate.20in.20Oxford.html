<p>Hi, I'm looking for a postdoc to work on probabilistic programming, possibly including categorical theories of probability. Maybe you saw my CPS tutorial or talk. <br>

<p>Hi, I'm looking for three more research associates (postdocs) in Oxford. Job ads <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/2143-full.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/2144-full.html">here</a>; do apply to both.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The funding is based around probabilistic and quantum programming, but the work topics are fairly flexible. As the essential criteria I put </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expertise in one or more of the following areas (in alphabetical order): category theory, measure theory, probabilistic programming, programming language theory, quantum theory, statistical machine learning, or theory of statistics, evidenced by published papers.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oxford is a lively place. Here's <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html#team">my current immediate group</a>. Beyond myself, there are quite a few category-theory-sympathetic people in CS (e.g. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/pl/people.html">PL</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/fls/people.html">Quantum</a>) and lots of interaction, with various informal seminars etc.; also there's even more in maths and over in Quantinuum etc..</p>
</li>
<li>Closing date 19th April 2023 noon UK time. Let me know if you need longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, let me know about any questions, if you're curious, or if you know people who might be.</p>

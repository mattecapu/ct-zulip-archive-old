<p>The Department of Mathematics of the University of Manchester is advertising a Lectureship in Pure Mathematics, with Logic explicitly mentioned as one of the possible areas for the appointment. For those unfamiliar with the UK system, a lectureship is a permanent position, involving research, teaching and administration. I think it is somewhat comparable to an Assistant Professorship in the USA.</p>
<p>Further details can be found at <a href="https://www.jobs.manchester.ac.uk/Job/JobDetail?JobId=26613">this web page</a>. The deadline for applications is 2nd November 2023.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Topos Institute is hiring a postdoctoral research fellow to study <a href="http://www.dspivak.net/grants/AFOSR2020-Topos-Supplement2021.pdf">aspects of polynomial functors and their applications</a>. More information and an application can be found on <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/18637">mathjobs</a>.</p>
<p>Applicants should be strong in mathematics or computer science and know category theory. Strong programming experience or strong math research experience is required, and a combination of the two is preferred. The position is for 1 year, but a renewal may be possible, depending on funding.</p>
<p>Topos is committed to building a team with diverse perspectives and life experiences, so those with underrepresented personal or professional backgrounds are highly encouraged to apply. Unfortunately, Topos is unable to sponsor visas for international candidates at this time. </p>
<p>We are looking to hire as soon as possible. Please feel free to contact David Spivak (<a href="mailto:david@topos.institute">david@topos.institute</a>) if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I have a fully funded PhD studentship for a student starting next academic year. Unfortunately the funding is restricted to home students. If you are interested in category theory, (co)monads, logic, string diagrams or other areas close to my interests, please get in touch to discuss potential research topics.</p>
<p>More details and the full advert can be found on my teaching page:</p>

<p>The deadline of June 30th is quite tight.</p>

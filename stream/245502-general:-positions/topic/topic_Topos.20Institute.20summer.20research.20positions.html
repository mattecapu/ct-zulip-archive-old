<p>Summer RAs are an important part of life at Topos — they help explore new directions relevant to Topos projects, and they bring new ideas, energy, and expertise to our research groups. This year we’ll welcome a new cohort of RAs to our offices in Berkeley, CA, with the program running from June to August.</p>

<p>RAs will be responsible for performing an in-depth research or teaching project, mentored by a Topos faculty mentor or advisor. This year possible mentors may include Conal Elliott, Valeria de Paiva, Evan Patterson, Dana Scott, David Spivak, and others. RAs will work closely with their mentor to define and pursue a research project.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, are there any plans to host RAs in the Oxford office?</p>

<p>That's an interesting idea, but I think not: Brendan Fong said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good: Dana Scott is excited about mentoring a project! He's suggested a project about a recent preprint of Peter Hines 'On strict reflexive extensionality in compact closed categories', but seems open to other topics too. So you could get paid to spend a summer learning from Dana Scott!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad: We can't sponsor US work visas, so it's mostly an opportunity for people already based in the US in some way.</p>

<p>"Topos is not able to sponsor visas for applicants." means that this is only open to US candidates?</p>

<p>AFAIU, it means that non-US candidates would have to already possess US work rights or get them through their own devices. If you'd like further clarification, I could put you in touch with someone in Topos Institute admin who is more qualified to answer this question.</p>

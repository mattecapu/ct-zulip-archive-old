<p>I would like to let you know I am rewriting my webpage (of A. Grothendieck) based on two classifications of Grothendieck himself <a href="/user_uploads/21317/wszXknzEI1Ho9O1CwCp6SduE/IMG_0790.PNG">IMG_0790.PNG</a> <a href="/user_uploads/21317/NyvquCm156aSv4cfqpra3C5Z/IMG_0791.jpeg">IMG_0791.jpeg</a> and to call your attention to the fact that the (audio) lectures that Grothendieck gave at Buffalo (topoi, algebraic geometry and algebraic groups) are now available in the section <strong>1970 - 1974</strong>. The page is still work in progress. <a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/">https://agrothendieck.github.io/</a> Let me know how can I improve the page. Thanks</p>

<p>In a very interesting letter to R Brown (5.5.1982) Grothendieck says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quillen had, among other nice ideas on foundations of “non-commutative homological algebra”, an elegant formulation of the notion of (non-strict?) n-category in terms of certain special “n-fold” simplicial sets (i.e. contravariant functors from S^n_* to (Ens)), and also, if I remember well, a general philosophy of how to define the analogues of algebraic structures such as groups, torsors, rings, etc. in the context of n-categories (so as to get the right n-groupoid version of objects such as simplicial groups, rings and the like) – possibly also did he have a good idea about a non-abelian Dold theorem, which it might be worthwhile to compare with your ideas on the subject. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and ends the letter with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept was general nonsense, too, and for a thousand years or two mathematics was more or less stagnating, because nobody was around to make<br>
such childish steps . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to think that the letters to L Breen (in the '70s) and to Quillen (in '80s) and Pursuing stacks were the most earlier documents about homotopy (of Grothendieck). But diving recently on the archives Grothendieck (Cote n 111) I found another one of 1968, with relation to the cited part of the letter to Brown.</p>
<p><a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/tapisQscan.pdf">https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/tapisQscan.pdf</a></p>
<p>and a project of transcription (started today) <a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/tapisQ.pdf">https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/tapisQ.pdf</a></p>
<p>It has three sections<br>
I. Relation entre catégories et ensembles semi-simpliciaux<br>
II. n-catégories, catégories n-uples, et Gr-catégories<br>
III. Point de vue “motivique” en théorie du cobordisme</p>
<p>It is a short note, but I hope you enjoy it reading it.</p>

<p>At first, I was amazed too, but in PS we read (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, it had been rather clear from the start that Verdier’s constructions could be adapted and did make sense for non-commutative homotopy set-ups, which was also apparent in between the lines in Gabriel-Zisman’s book on the foundations of homotopy theory, and a lot more explicitly in Quillen’s axiomatization of homotopical algebra. This axiomatization I found very appealing indeed – <strong>and right now still his little book is my most congenial and main source of information on foundational matters of homotopical algebra</strong>. I remember though my being a little disappointed at Quillen’s not caring either to pursue the matter of what exactly a “non-commutative triangulated category structure” (of the type he was getting from his model categories) was, just contenting himself to mumble a few words about existence of “higher structure” (then just the Dold-Puppe sequences), which (he implies) need to be understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book (Homotopical algebra) of Quillen is from 1967 and he spent the year 1968–1969 as a Sloan Fellow at the IHES, that was surely an occasion for Grothendieck to getting acquaintance with Quillen's homotopy theory.</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I would like to communicate you some projects, first, there is a zulip server for projects related to Grothendieck</p>
<p>Zulip<br>

<p>I have also created a simple form of a mailing list on the webpage for important news on projects related to Grothendieck (subscribe if you think the Zulip is in a way too much)</p>
<p>Mailing list<br>

<p>With your help, I would like to begin a new project.<br>
Some years ago, there was a project around Pursuing stacks here<br>
<a href="https://github.com/thescrivener/PursuingStacks">https://github.com/thescrivener/PursuingStacks</a></p>
<p>They typed almost all the material and left behind a small to-do list (but now the main contributor seems it is not active). In the light of the <a href="https://grothendieck.umontpellier.fr/archives-grothendieck/">Archives Grothendieck</a> we now have a better scan of PS. I would like to add the appendix of chapter I (some letters to L Breen) as originally planned and complete some of the points of the to-do list. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to know whether someone has the technical ability to make works the source code (of GitHub) in Overleaf and share it with me, to move forward in the project. I have made some serious attempts to do it myself without success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>I've seen various tries but people get overwhelmed with such a big task. And I am saying this not only in the sense of length, at the beginning there is a "Promenade Through a Life's Work" and you could think the whole text is going to be about a mixture of recollections of life and mathematics. The reality is that a reader (and even more a translator) needs a lot of patience to get over the parts of the entire text (an immense diary of a very rich life). I want to be of any help here, but the translation to English is not a short-term project for me. </p>
<p>Lately, there is a new one<br>
<a href="https://github.com/SayantanRoy95/R-et-S">https://github.com/SayantanRoy95/R-et-S</a><br>
The project is in its initial stage, but I have the intention to contribute there from time to time. </p>
<p>I confess here, I think his mathematics (make them easier to find and read) is a more urgent task.</p>
<p>Hope this helps in some sense!</p>

<p>Thanks for your supportive words. <em>If I have noted something in the creative process of Grothendieck is simply generosity</em>. </p>
<p>One of the sections of R&amp;S is called: "Yin le Serviteur (2) - ou la générosité". As an early-career researcher, I am trying to grow in terms of generosity, and in particular with the efforts of the great mathematician Grothendieck. But these are too many words, I prefer to make the efforts and let them talk by themselves.</p>

<p>Grothendieck 28 march 1928 - 13 nov. 2014</p>
<p>As a commemoration of the death of A. Grothendieck, I have created a new section on the <a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/">webpage</a> called "Letters". </p>
<p>It contains the collection of his correspondence with Serre, Mumford, and Brown. Besides that, I have uploaded an archive where I am going to put my hundred collection of his mathematical letters (work in progress), in this process, I am going to contact the mathematicians implicated for his permission.</p>
<p><a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/letters.pdf">https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/letters.pdf</a></p>
<p>For at least 10 years I have had the hope that at some point the right occasion would arise to propose the publication, in a suitably edited form, of a large number of your mathematical letters to your friends. For me, the letters that you wrote me are by far the most important things which explained your ideas and insights. The letters are vivid and clear and unencumbered by the customary style of formal French publications. I assume that the letters you wrote to others are similar. They express succinctly the essential ideas and motivations and often give quite complete ideas about how to overcome the main technical problems. I have been very conscious of the difficulties that the younger generation has in getting a clear idea of your theories. This may be blunt and insensitive, but I should say that I find the style of the finished works, esp. EGA, to be difficult and sometimes unreadable because of its attempt to reach a superhuman level of completeness. But, for myself, I never liked Bourbaki either! This is a personal thing, but the point is that your letters would offer a clear alternative for students who wished to gain access rapidly to the core of your ideas. My proposal would be to approach someone with a broad knowledge of your theories, such as Artin or Mazur, and give them permission to approach the others to whom you wrote at length to send them copies of your letters (with personal details removed). They could then examine the whole corpus and glue and paste and provide orienting remarks, producing a first draft of a publication for you to review. I feel sure that such a collection would be extremely useful to the younger generation, many of whom don’t have a good appreciation of your ideas at all. I’m not just thinking of motives or D-modules ∼ crystals of which you write at length. I find equally distressing the lack of understanding of duality (no-one reads Hartshorne’s book on duality because they find it too long), of topoi /stacks (or the related general existence theorem of Artin’s), or (earliest of all) the comparison theorem for π1 (never published outside SGA1 I believe). There are hordes of smaller but crucial insights such as your letter to me about the yoga of Koszul (φ◦ψ = (−1)^ab ψ◦φ,...) which showed me what was what with determinant bundles.1 What do you think? The collection of letters would also serve as a key to the other published things—SGA, EGA.<br>

<p>Abstract: In a text of 1971 entitled The New Universal Church, the famous mathematician Alexander Grothendieck defended that through a process of imperialist expansion, science has created an ideology of its own, scientism, that has many of the features of a new religion. He called it "La nouvelle église universelle". How does Grothendieck's text against scientism and the imperialism of science relate to his thought? How does it relate to his mathematics as well as to his ideas about religions? Can it be said that Grothendieck had become against science or that, in some sense, he had always been against some form of science? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this webinar.</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I hope and pray you and your families are all safe and well.</p>
<p>In a letter to Professor Ronnie Brown, Grothendieck notes "a strange fact":</p>
<p>"One interesting question here which I did not clear up yet, is, whether weak equivalence for a map of hemispherical complexes can be explicitly tested in terms of the source and target maps, just the same way as if we had actual ∞-groupoids or ∞-Gr-stacks (never mind whether associativities are strict or not), when the homotopy groups can be computed directly in terms of these extra structures. When you write down the condition that you get isomorphisms for these, it turns out though that the condition makes sense in terms of the source-and-target structure alone, without having to use the composition laws at all (nor even degeneracies). This is a strange fact, which should be understood."<br>
--Grothendieck, in a letter to Professor Ronnie Brown (p. 26, <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf">https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf</a> )</p>
<p>I am wondering if the strange fact:</p>
<p>"source-and-target structure alone"</p>
<p>has been understood. For instance, does the "source-and-target structure alone" correspond to the theory of irreflexive directed multigraphs (see Lawvere and Schanuel's Conceptual Mathematics, p. 150)?</p>
<p>thanking you,<br>
posina</p>

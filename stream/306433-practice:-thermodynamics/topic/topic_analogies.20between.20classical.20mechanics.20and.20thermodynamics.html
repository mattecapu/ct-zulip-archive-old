<p>I feel like there is an essentially "open" quality to analysis of flow like this that is absent from the "closed" perspective of Hamiltonian mechanics, and I would like to understand how to bring this kind of thing into the more general setting of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

<p>You might like my work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11392">open Hamitonian systems</a>.  But so far it's just getting started - there's a lot of stuff I know should be done, that we didn't get around to!  For example we worked out the open Euler-Lagrange equations but didn't write about them, and there should also be an open version of Hamilton's equations.</p>

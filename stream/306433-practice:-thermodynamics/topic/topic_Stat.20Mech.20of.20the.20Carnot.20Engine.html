<p>There's some <em>weird</em> stuff going on with the Carnot Engine if we think about it from a statistical mechanical perspective.</p>
<p>While the gas is thermally connected to a heat bath, the ensemble for its state is a canonical ensemble. Thus, when we close the connection with the heat bath, the ensemble <em>should still be a canonical ensemble</em>, because we haven't observed that it is at a specific energy. But now we are in a very weird state, we know that energy can't flow in or out (which is typically accompanied by a microcanonical ensemble), but we are in a canonical ensemble!!</p>

<p>I now am going to see what happens as we slowly expand the chamber by slowly decreasing the external pressure, I expect what will happen is that we evolve to some weird non-canonical ensemble!!</p>

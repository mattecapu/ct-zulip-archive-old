<p>I am extremely inclined to believe that the Moore appearing "Eilenberg-Moore" is <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/John+Moore">John Moore</a>, algebraic topologist, but there's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_F._Moore">Edward Moore</a>, who worked in automata theory, and considering that Eilenberg was... well, he did both things with great profit, this seems a philological conundrum that can be solved only finding the original paper where Eilenberg and one of these Moore introduce the category of algebras for a monad. What is this paper called?</p>

<p>(To make things worse, the two Moore were also almost exactly the same age with respect to Eilenberg, and born not so far from each other... I can't imagine how this problem is addressed for people who wrote with Erdős ;-) )</p>

<p>I'm very surprised that the original paper doesn't appear on the nLab. I'll add it there now.</p>

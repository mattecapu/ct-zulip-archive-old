<p>My life is changing now that I've finished all papers with grad students except for one!   Here's my to-do list now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finish "Structured versus decorated cospans" with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276972">@Kenny</span>  and @<strong>Christina V</strong> .    Submitted to the arXiv and <em>Transactions of the AMS</em>, but Kenny and I are still writing up all details of the proofs of two theorems, which involve lots of big commutative diagrams.  We're meeting once a week on Mondays at 11 to work on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit LaTeX of "Open systems in classical mechanics" to <em>Journal of Mathematical Physics</em>, who accepted this paper with David Weisbart and Adam Yassine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on "Schur functors" with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>.  Stalled, but soon to be revived.   It's about 3/4 done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk for Friday  February 5, 2021 on "Structured versus Decorated Cospans" for the Yorkshire and Midlands Category Seminar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk for Monday March 8, 2021 at the Zurich Theoretical Physics Colloquium, perhaps called "Theoretical Physics in the 21st Century", as part of their Sustainability Week.    The idea is to talk about the most exciting areas in physics... but with an emphasis on what physicists can do to save the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk  for Thursday March 18, 2021 for the Topos Institute seminar.   Maybe something similar to 4. but with applied category theory instead of physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk on octonions and the Standard Model for Kirill Krasnov's workshop on this seminar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write an article on condensed matter physics for <em>Nautilus</em> magazine.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd say that even if that were true, that's not what matters. At the rate that research gets done, it can be hard for anyone (even yourself) to keep track of the bigger picture of what you're aiming to achieve, and to really appreciate all of the things you've got going on.  Most days in research it can feel like you're just ‚Äú[trying] really hard to finish the big proof in the paper [you're] currently writing‚Äù, or even something more mundane than that. Not all of us can write as prolifically as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>, but I feel we could certainly add something to the atmosphere here by not only hearing about things when they're finished, but also having some anticipation regarding projects which are still in the works.</p>

<p>These aren't research promises or proposals. No one will hold you to account if you don't deliver the stuff you said you might work on. It's just an extra piece of the experience of research that might be improved by its sharing with the community.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>All</em> other people's work?  So you think you're working on the least interesting and important topics of everyone in the world?   If so, why are you doing that?</p>
<p><em>Some</em> other people's work?  So the existence of some people doing something more interesting and important makes you unwilling to talk about yours?  That seems like quite a high standard to hold yourself to... like the composer who did not release his compositions because he knew Brahms and Wagner.  (I forget his name.)</p>
<p>First of all, I know a bit about your work, and it seems interesting and important.    Second of all, and more importantly, I have a lot of trouble understanding people who aren't eager to talk about their work.  I work on things that seem fun and interesting, so naturally - well, so it seems to me, but apparently it's not so natural - I want to talk about these things, just to let other people share my pleasure.  It's like if you take a bite of a great cake at a restaurant you say "yum!  this tastes sort of like strawberry, but also..."</p>
<p>Of course it takes longer than saying "yum".  I guess one excuse I <em>can</em> imagine for not wanting to talk about one's work is "I'm having so much fun working on this that I don't want to stop and take the time to bring other people up to speed".</p>

<p>I do suspect, though, that the kinds of people who are interested in letting the world know what they're working on now are going to be mostly the same kinds of people who do things like write regular blog entries and edit the nLab.  I know I'm a person like that, and I know a lot of people aren't.  I've never really figured out exactly what the difference is, but in my experience trying to convince someone to "become" a person like that is kind of like trying to convince an introvert (like me) that they would be happier if they went to more parties.</p>

<p>Oh, I like talking about it, but in my experience people are usually rather nonplussed, since I seem to be falling in the gap between category theory proper and other fields. This is probably a good thing, but it means it seems hard to get serious feedback. And the geographical isolation doesn't help.</p>

<p>more importantly, I have a lot of trouble understanding people who aren't eager to talk about their work.  I work on things that seem fun and interesting, so naturally - well, so it seems to me, but apparently, it's not so natural - I want to talk about these things, just to let other people share my pleasure.  It's like if you take a bite of a great cake at a restaurant you say "yum!  this tastes sort of like strawberry, but also..."</p>

<p>But you must have thought about people like Newton, or Gauss, or Perlman. They had no need to tell anyone. For many people, math is not a social process. It is a conversation with god. With Pythagorean god. Why does the sun rise every day. Why do the planets swipe the same areas, and don't move on the spheres circumscribed over the platonic solids? Someone wants to pay money for a law of nature. Or they want an interview. It is so needlessly distracting...</p>
<p>But such people also don't like strawberies I guess.</p>

<p>I eventually remembered that some people have more fun just <em>doing</em> math:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess one excuse I can imagine for not wanting to talk about one's work is "I'm having so much fun working on this that I don't want to stop and take the time to bring other people up to speed".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And such people don't all need to be as good as Newton, Gauss or Perelman!</p>

<p>The (coloured/typed) operad whose category of algebras is equivalent to the category of uncoloured operads is defined in Higher-Dimensional Algebra III: n-Categories and the Algebra of Opetopes, Section 3.1. Was this operad known before this paper?</p>

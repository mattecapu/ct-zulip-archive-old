<p>Following the Unicode mailing list, I recently read <a href="https://corp.unicode.org/pipermail/unicode/2021-September/009552.html">this message</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that the symbol U+22B6 has been used first by Joachim Kock from UAB Barcelona Maths Department. He is also using on a website, last modified in 2006, four years before the already mentioned paper “Polynomial functors and opetopes” had been published.[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The symbol has been “borrowed” from other authors, e. g. [2], [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe Mr. Kock can provide more information about the origin of that<br>
character and also answer the other questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "U+22B6" being referred to is the symbol '⊶'.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276625">@Joachim Kock</span>, not sure if this query has already been passed on to you via other channels?</p>

<p>I think he doesn't read this very much...</p>

<p>Thanks for the ping!</p>
<p>This is funny. I didn't even know ⊶ was a unicode symbol.</p>
<p>I started using it with André Joyal, Michael Batanin, and Jean-François Mascari in 2004 for what we called the zoom relation.  (That was long before  Zoom the app.) A zoom complex is a sequence of trees with circles, with a bijection between between circles in one tree and nodes of the next tree (and a bijection between nodes in one tree and leaves in the next). These bijections is the zoom relation. The symbol ⊶ is thus 'onomatopoetic'. Zoom complexes are a combinatorial model for the opetopes, and the zoom relation is implicit already in the work of Baez and Dolan.</p>
<p>To print the symbol in the paper, we had to use a little postscript figure in a \savebox. Nowadays it can be obtained with tikz arrow heads</p>
<p>-Circle and -{Circle[open]}.</p>

<p>This is the topic for David Spivak's guest lecture which is to happen on March 27th:</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic organizational systems: from deep learning to prediction markets</strong></p>
<p>The abstract is below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In training artificial neural networks (ANNs), both neurons and arbitrary populations of neurons can be seen to perform the same type of task. Indeed, at any given moment they provide a function A--&gt;B, and given any input from A and loss signal on B, they do two things: provide an updated function A--&gt;B and backpropagate a loss signal on A. Populations of neurons, which we called "Learners", can be put together in series or in parallel, forming a symmetric monoidal category. However, ANNs satisfy an additional property: there is a consistent method by which the functions update and errors backpropagate; namely, they all use gradient descent. The chain rule implies that the composite of gradient descenders is again a gradient descender.<br>
In this talk I will discuss a generalization called "dynamic organizational systems", which includes ANNs, prediction markets, Hebbian learning, and strategic games. It is founded on the category Poly of polynomial functors, which generalizes Lens. I will review the relevant background on Poly and then explain dynamic organizational systems as coherent procedures by which a network of component systems can rewire its network structure in response to the data flowing through it. I'll explain the ANN case, and possibly the prediction market case, time permitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lecture will happen at 5PM UK time, instead of 4PM as we've had it usually for Cats4AI.</p>

<p>Could you please update the website (<a href="https://cats.for.ai/program/">https://cats.for.ai/program/</a>) with the recording  link? (Also for Jules' talk)</p>

<p>My bad! I've been moving countries and got pretty behind on tasks. I've just added the recording links to the website and will add the slides once we have them</p>

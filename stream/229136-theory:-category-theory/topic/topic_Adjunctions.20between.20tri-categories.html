<p>Hi everyone. I am looking for a reference on adjunctions between tri-categories. <br>
More precisely,  I am looking for a characterization of a tri-functor having a left adjoint in terms of bi-equivalences of hom-bicategories/universal arrows (instead of using unit/counit transformations and coherences).<br>
In the case of (1/bi)categories, one knows that a (pseudo)functor R:C-&gt;D has a left (bi)adjoint if for any d : D, there is an object L(d) : C together with (for any object c : C), an isomorphism/equivalence (of sets, resp. categories) between C(L d, c)  and D(d, R c).<br>
Following this, one could expect that a tri-functor R:C-&gt;D has a left tri-adjoint if for any d : D, there is an object L(d) : C together with (for any object c : C), a biequivalence between the bicategories C(L d, c) and D(d, R c). <br>
However, if one looks at the definition of an adjunction between (infty,1)-categories (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+%28infinity%2C1%29-functor#CharacterizationInTermsOfHomEquivalences">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+%28infinity%2C1%29-functor#CharacterizationInTermsOfHomEquivalences</a>), one does already require that L is a functor and that the unit is already a transformation. However, in the case of 1 and bi-categories, this automatically follows from the equivalence hom-sets/categories.  <br>
As a summary, I would like to know whether it is sufficient to only give the the assignment ob(D) -&gt; ob(C) (on objects) and the bi-equivalence of hom-bicategories, or that more data/properties have to be given (as in the (infty,1) case).</p>

<p>Of course. What's surprising to me is that having a <em>local</em> adjunction on hom-objects doesn't necessarily imply that globally we can have at <em>most</em> a lax 2-adjunction. We surely have a lax 2-adjunction -- but we also have something much stronger.</p>
<p>In other words -- we locally have a (strict) adjunction, and globally too!  I'm not sure if I'm alone in appreciating this, but this feels very "fractal", for the lack of a better word.</p>

<p>Another way to say this is that it's surprising that the proof that  the hom-set isomorphism following from unit-counit  definition <em>depends</em> on the fact that 1-cells are strictly functorial, and not laxly so.</p>

<p>I've reviewed the proofs and now I'm convinced the nlab page is right. If you have a monoidal monad on a monoidal category, the left and right strength commute. And you can show that the monad is necessarily symmetric monoidal as well. So that paper is wrong in saying their monad is not symmetric monoidal. I guess this shows that their models cannot be <em>monadic</em> adjunctions (none of their examples were anyway).</p>
<p>I guess this is a generalization of Eckmann-Hilton?</p>

<p>It comes from my work on gradual typing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00061">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00061</a> That paper is phrased in terms of double categories that are pro-arrow equipments, and there's a way to define pro-arrow equipments using fibrations so I was wondering if there was a word for this additional axiom that we have.</p>

<p>As you probably know - but just in case you don't - when Shulman gets pro-arrow equipments from bifibrations in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1286">Framed bicategories and monoidal fibrations</a>, in Definition 13.31 he introduces various special kinds of bifibrations, like Beck-Chevalley, strong Beck-Chevalley, weak Beck-Chevalley, etc.   I needed to learn about these in my work on decorated and structured cospan double categories.   But I don't think he mentions the kind you're talking about.</p>

<p>This seems quite an unusual property to impose on an equipment: asking for every induced adjunction to be a coreflection is asking for every morphism in the underlying 2-category to be fully faithful. Accordingly, the condition is in a sense an equipment-theoretic version of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cancellative+category">left cancellative (2-)category</a>. I would suspect that such structures are not particularly widespread.</p>

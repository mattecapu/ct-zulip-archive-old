<p>(I split the topic too since this is no longer about chemistry)</p>

<p>a long time ago, Ross Duncan and I were looking for some kind of categorical interpretation of !-boxes as comonads or similar, but never got anywhere. as Amar said, the challenge is instantiating them within a diagram changes the types of morphisms around them, which is very much not functor-like. We ultimately settled on them being described purely as syntax, living at the level of graphs</p>

<p>the earliest i've seen something like functorial box (or "functorial bubble") notation is in the appendix of Spinors and Spacetime (Penrose and Rindler, 1984). the authors introduce string diagram notations for various differential operations on tensors by drawing different kinds of bubbles around them</p>

<p>however, they don't insist that composition (aka tensor contraction) is preserved, so they are an instance of something more general than a functorial box. also, many times there are different numbers of wires on the outside of a box than the inside. for instance, taking the gradient of a scalar field yields a vector field. this is pictured as a box with no wires inside and 1 wire outside</p>

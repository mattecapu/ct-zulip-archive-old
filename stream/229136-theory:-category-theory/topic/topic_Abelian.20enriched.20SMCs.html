<p>I find myself working on something where I would like to describe the differences between two maps in a common Hom set of a symmetric monoidal category <strong>C</strong>, which makes sense if  <strong>C</strong> is enriched over <strong>Ab</strong>. Taking a cue from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category], this would seem to make <strong>C</strong>  a "preadditive SMC". This terminology is direct enough as it goes, but these categories seem to have a nice enough structure (seemingly an example of a category of R-modules) that perhaps it has a pithier name or a nice characterisation. Is there standard terminology / a standard result which can be used to describe such SMCs?</p>

<p>I'd call it a symmetric monoidal Ab-category, which while lengthy has the advantage that anyone who knows enriched category theory will instantly understand it.</p>

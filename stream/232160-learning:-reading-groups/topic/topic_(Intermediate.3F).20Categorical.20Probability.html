<p>Hey all, is anyone interested in a reading group on categorical probability papers?  I've heard some interest already from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515024">@Marius Furter</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275940">@Matt Cuffaro (he/him)</span> and the like. I think a few of us have read a bit of the seminal stuff, but would like to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>I think my personal goals are to really build up my language so I can have some stronger dialogue with the Innsbruck, Oxford, and Nijmegen groups. And if beginners would like to join, I would gladly explain everything I know so far! And obviously if people from the above groups would wanna help us with direction, it would be kindly appreciated <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>Hi! There was a discussion a while ago about introductory material <a href="#narrow/stream/253118-theory.3A-probability/topic/best.20intro.20in.202022">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for that Paolo! Maybe I should start another thread for intermediate reading suggestions? I think Marius and Matt and I have already read a fair bit, or have even done some of our own work/collaborated with people, but want to get really comfortable with some of the more involved examples and concepts.</p>

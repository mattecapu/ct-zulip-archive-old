<p>I am focusing on this book as my preferred introductory-level category theory book.</p>
<p>Exercise 1.1.2 is about showing that a monoid is a category. I understand the general concept, but I realized I was unsure about an aspect of the identity.</p>
<p>I am not currently sure if every arrow in a category could have two identity arrows (a left and right), or if every identity arrow must be two-sided.</p>
<p>Similarly, while I assume a monoid has a unique, two-sided identity element, I wonder if there is a structure where each element has a left and right identity.</p>
<p>I was browsing on Wikipedia and there’s a chance this has something to do with the Grothendieck group.</p>
<p>Is it possible to relax the condition that a monoid have a two-sided identity; and if so, what kind of structure is that?<a href="/user_uploads/21317/UBDI1Zsp0mtFDGpfMNWA3JkE/A9046F42-5C36-4A00-9490-48DE1F26F774.png">A9046F42-5C36-4A00-9490-48DE1F26F774.png</a></p>

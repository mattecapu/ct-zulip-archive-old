<p>Can anyone recommend a good general math reference text? </p>

<p>Math is such a huge subject that it's hard to introduce even the basics in one book.   You mention "groups, rings, fields, topology, etc."  If we skip the "etc." and focus on those 4 things you can learn about them from an introductory algebra book and an introductory topology book.</p>

<p>Everyone who goes into  pure math winds up studying some algebra and some topology, and they'll have different opinions on books.  Without much confidence I might recommend Jacobson's <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basic-Algebra-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486471896">Basic Algebra I</a></em> and Munkres' <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Topology-Classic-Version-Math-Classics/dp/0134689518/ref=sr_1_1?crid=W6PJHGKHGLX0&amp;keywords=munkres+topology&amp;qid=1663105537&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=munkres+topology%2Cstripbooks%2C238&amp;sr=1-1">Topology</a></em> - they are, at least, famous standard treatments that cover the basic stuff.</p>

<p>If you want a less thorough introduction to topology that emphasizes its connection to category theory, try Bradley, Bryerson and Terilla's <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262359627/topology/">Topology: a Categorical Approach</a></em>.  I really like this book.  You won't come out of it knowing all the standard basic stuff, but you'll probably have more fun and understand some things more deeply.</p>

<p>For a truly general overview of math written by one of inventors of category theory, I recommend <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematics-Form-Function-Saunders-MacLane/dp/0387962174">Mathematics: Form and Function</a></em> by Mac Lane.   It's not a substitute for books on specific topics.</p>

<p>Just in case it might be helpful, here are a couple things I've learned when self-studying math:</p>
<ul>
<li>For me, it's tempting to work on books that are a bit too hard. But I find that it really is worth it to try and find books that are easy enough - it feels like it's a more sustainable activity for me when I don't have to push myself too hard to make progress in a book. Gradually books become easier as I learn more, and it's exciting to return to a book that used to be too hard, but isn't anymore.</li>
<li>If a book has solutions/hints/answers to exercises, that can be incredibly helpful. Otherwise it can take a really long time to realize one is missing something simple.</li>
<li>I think it's mostly true that one "uses everything one learns" in a math context. So if you're not in a hurry to learn a particular thing, just learning about whatever seems accessible and fun/interesting can be a good way to go. It's hard to know how interesting/relevant a given topic is until one learns at least a tiny bit about it.</li>
</ul>

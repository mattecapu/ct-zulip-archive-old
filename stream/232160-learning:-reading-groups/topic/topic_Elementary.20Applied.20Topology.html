<p>Would anyone be interested in a reading group on Robert Ghrist's Elementary Applied Topology?</p>
<p>A lot of the math should be familiar to anyone who has taken a course in algebraic topology, but it's presented in interestingly different ways, and there are a lot of diagrams to puzzle over (none of the diagrams are explicitly referenced in the text, or have any captions). It's also beautifully typeset: <a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html">https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html</a></p>

<p>I started reading it and then I got lost in another million of things to do. I am not sure I can commit enough time to make it, but for sure I would be interested.</p>

<p>I have a copy of this book, but I think it's best when supplemented with other texts. Most of the book is a series of (beautiful) sketches that don't go into much detail.</p>

<p>I found that in order to understand what was going on I needed to consult other sources.</p>

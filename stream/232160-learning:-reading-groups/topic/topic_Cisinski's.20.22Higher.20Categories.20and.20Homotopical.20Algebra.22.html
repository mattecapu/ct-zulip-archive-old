<p>Starting in a week and a half the Categories and Logic Reading Group will be starting a group read of this book.  This reading group has gone through a couple of books already including Bart Jacobs' "Categorical Logic and Type Theory" and has some members with experience in reading groups going back probably 10 years, so I hope I'm not jinxing things too much by saying the group is unlikely to disappear on you or fail to make progress.  Meetings are held by Google Meet on Sundays, currently 5:00PM (17:00) New York City time and the usual format is that a volunteer discussion leader for the week (usually from the core group) prepares a chapter or two and the presentation and discussion last up to 2 hours depending on the depth and breadth of the material; extra time is used for exercises or informal discussion.</p>
<p>Anyone interested can feel free to drop me a DM with your email address and I will get you an invite, or if you would prefer not to disclose your email address I will DM you the Meet link and you can attend as a guest.  Other questions should probably go in the thread.  The first meeting of the new book is at <time datetime="2023-09-17T21:00:00Z">2023-09-17T17:00:00-04:00</time> and will likely cover the Preface and part of the Prelude.  You can find the book itself at <a href="https://cisinski.app.uni-regensburg.de/CatLR.pdf">https://cisinski.app.uni-regensburg.de/CatLR.pdf</a> .</p>

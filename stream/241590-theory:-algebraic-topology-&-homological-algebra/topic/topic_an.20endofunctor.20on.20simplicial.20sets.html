<p>Coends are honestly pretty cool. I find CWM's section on them to be a very straightforward elaboration of their basic properties. <br>
I didn't appreciate how important they were until I started spending more time on enriched category theory in June/July. In the 2-category V-CAT, the unit for the tensor product of V-categories does not generally coincide with the terminal V-category, much like how in an arbitrary monoidal category we don't expect the unit object to be terminal. The upshot is that there is no way to speak about a "constant functor" from C to an object in D -objects in D are in one-to-one correspondence with functors from the unit object 1, but there might not be a canonical choice of functor C -&gt; 1 which makes this work. Even over Ab, for C an Ab-enriched category, there's no reason to expect there to be any additive functor to the one object category 1 with Hom(1,1)=Z, much less a canonical choice of one. (The terminal category 0 has Hom(0,0)=0, the zero abelian group). As a result the entire theory of limits and colimits all just falls apart, one cannot speak of the limit or colimit of a diagram in general. Maybe this all sounds trivial but it was quite striking to me. We have to use these weighted limits/colimits instead which are defined in terms of ends/coends.</p>

<p>But on the bright side the whole theory of weighted limits/colimits is quite elegant. The characterization of the presheaf category as free cocompletion becomes almost definitional from this POV as the presheaf is one of the arguments to the colimit.</p>

<p>Personally I would prefer to emphasise weighted (co)limits, for that reason. I find it a pity that they are not covered in CWM.</p>

<p>And only a few weeks ago I read Ross Street's paper on "Yoneda-structures on 2-categories" where he shows that the theory of weighted colimits is more adequately suited for the formal 2-categorical stuff. This really blew me away, and it helped to give a somewhat more concrete reason why the pointwise Kan extensions are so important - they're equivalent to a kind of relative left adjoint, i.e. an "absolute" Kan lift rather than an ordinary Kan lift.</p>

<p>Zhen lin, yes! It is a shame. And still not in the recent textbooks either, I don't think, but I haven't looked. It is somewhat irritating to me that it took me so long to learn the "right definition" of the geometric realization of a simplicial set as the notion of weighted colimit is not so well talked about.</p>

<p>Forget the book by Hatcher, where a "delta complex" is described as handwavily as possible, although it's just the geometric realization of a "semisimplicial" set...</p>

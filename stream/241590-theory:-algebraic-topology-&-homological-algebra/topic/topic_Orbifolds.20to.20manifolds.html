<p>For 2d orbifolds, is there a way to glue orbifolds say along or close to their singularities in such a way that the resulting space is a smooth manifold? Say can one glue two disks with a conic singularity of order 2 in such a way that one gets a genuine disk? I'm thinking that somehow this should come from the covering map but I don't see what the actual construction would be.</p>

<p>I'm looking to equip some objects that at least sometimes are made of cells with two kinds of subtly interrelated structure.  One of the kinds of structure basically amounts to "having degeneracies, in a nonalgebraic way".  I was hoping to get objects with this particular structure as cofibrant objects, and also obtain in some related way the class of morphisms that preserve the structure.  Can model categories do this?  Does the standard model structure on semi-simplicial sets do something like this already?</p>

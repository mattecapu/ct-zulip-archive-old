<p>Hi all. Usually for diffeomorphisms f of a smooth manifold X that are "connected" to the identity morphism, we can define a vector field \delta f, and there is also a notion of exponential of a vector field that gives a diffeomorphism of X. Is there a notion of "exponential of a k-vector field"? That is, given a 2-vector field (that is not necessarily decomposable into a single wedge product of two 1-vector fields), what does it mean to exponentiate this? Or is this generally an ill-defined notion? I haven't been able to find a resource that discusses this.</p>

<p>To provide participants with an opportunity to explore the area, especially Washington DC, we have deliberately left the afternoon session on Wednesday free of conference activities. Notably, all Smithsonian museums in DC are entirely free, although a few may require advance ticket reservations. Additionally, the area offers a wide array of captivating places and restaurants to discover. We strongly encourage participants to self-organize into small groups for their explorations. Please refer to the information provided regarding local travel concerns.</p>

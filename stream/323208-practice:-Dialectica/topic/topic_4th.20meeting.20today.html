<p>hi all, thanks for an excellent meeting today!<br>
 great slides Jonathan and Charlotte! please upload them to our Google Drive repo.</p>
<p>Things I want of all of us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Five questions that we want to work, on from each subgroup, to add to 20 questions. <br>
these questions have to be actionable, not too generic like "solve climate change".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic references from each group, already read, please.</p>
</li>
<li>github  and overleaf repos (where applicable) checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: I hope all the slides from the 4 previous meetings will be put in the respective folders in the Google Drive MRC-Dialectica: Dial-Games, Dial-Poly, Dial-Lenses, Dial-Calc (for calculations instead of implementation), together with the basic references, please. There should be 3 recordings of meetings, 4 chats and several sets of slides.</p>

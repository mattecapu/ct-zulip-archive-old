<p>The first proposition in the Poly book, page 13, states:</p>
<p>Proposition1.20. Poly has all products and coproducts and is completely distributive. Poly also has exponential objects, making it a bicartesian closed category. It therefore supports the simply typed lambda calculus.</p>
<p>Can you state a corresponding proposition for the dialectica categories and prove it with the material already at your disposal? send me email with your answers!</p>

<p>my answer would be<br>
Proposition1: LDial has all products and coproducts and is completely distributive. LDial also has exponential objects, making it a symmetric monoidal closed category. It therefore supports the simply typed linear lambda calculus.<br>
Proposition2: Dial has all products and  weak coproducts and is completely distributive. Dial also has exponential objects, making it a symmetric monoidal closed category. It therefore supports the simply typed linear lambda calculus.</p>

<p>The second proposition in the Poly book, page 14, states:<br>
Proposition1.21. Beyond the cocartesian and cartesian monoidal structures (0,+)and (1, ×), the category Poly has two additional monoidal structures, denoted (y, ⊗) and (y, ◦), which are together duoidal. Moreover ⊗ is a closed monoidal structure that distributes over coproducts, while ◦ is a left coclosed monoidal structure that preserves connected limits.</p>
<p>What is the dialectica corresponding proposition?</p>

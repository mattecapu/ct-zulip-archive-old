<p>As 2021 closes, I wanted to express my appreciation for this Category Theory zulip, and all the wonderful people who have participated in it.</p>
<p>It hasn't been the easiest year for me, and I suspect for many others. So, for me at least, it has been especially good to have a place like this - where I can learn about ideas brand-new to me, and share community with those who also find mathematics exciting and valuable.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has helped, and continues to help, create this place!</p>

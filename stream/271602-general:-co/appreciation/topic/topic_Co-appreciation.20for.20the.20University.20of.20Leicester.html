<p>They sound like statements that the AIs would make after taking over...</p>
<p>I'm sincerely anguished about this. It's nasty on so many levels. Not only you are put in a precarious spot but you're told it's "for excellence" like they'll be better off without you. It's even worse than "cutting costs". Nobody deserves this and knowing what a great researcher Simona is only compounds it.</p>

<p>I would wager that it is perhaps deliberate sabotage.  Corporations lobby for austerity, which forces universities to cut back on fundamental research and make profits through teaching and contracts with private industry, thus making money for the corporations involved: cheap research and less taxes.  I'm not sure if this is the case here, but this is definitely a pervasive issue in Canada, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Union members at University of Leicester have voted overwhelmingly in support of a no confidence motion in its vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>The University and College Union (UCU) members met yesterday to respond to the university’s proposed cuts that have left 145 staff members at risk of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Some 60 people could be made redundant at the end of a current consultation and staff have been angered by vice-chancellor Professor Nishan Canagarajah’s assertion that the move is needed to “continue to deliver excellence.”</p>
<p>Around 200 UCU members voted in the special meeting on Monday with 98 per cent supporting the motion and no one opposing it.</p>

<p>That's a good question.   By the way, the last time Leicester tried to fire its mathematicians (as described by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2016/09/disaster_at_the_leicester_math.html">Tom Leinster</a> in 2016), it was stopped by an international outcry, including from Sir Michael Atiyah who was actuallly Chancellor of that university between 1995 and 2005.</p>

<p>i witnessed the UCU in action for a couple of years. it works if the union local happens to be run by a motivated and capable person. but if it is an academic, then they sacrifice their original profession, which was meant to be research and teaching, to run a political battle. moreover, they may or may not be talented and educated to run a political battle.</p>
<p>the other side of the UCU-management interactions is even more interesting.  check a couple of principals at the UK universities. they tend to be ex-academics. if you scratch the surface, you notice that they tend to be those academics who are the first to give up their research program and become administrators. or those who never had a research program, but became academics by never leaving school. they develop a tight schedule for applying for research funding, study proposal writing and reuse, and networking. ((the research agencies are understaffed, and the program managers are overloaded and have to get rid of the money quickly, so they prefer large research networks. and the fish are inclined to biting into one another when the water for the fish soup starts getting warmer...)) </p>
<p>so the senior academic management consists of academics who were never really interested in research, but they also never studied management or were trained to run large organizations. the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>and they themselves, of course, know both about their research accomplishments and about their political acumen more than anyone. so they feel obliged to impose the sharpest performance requirements on their researchers, lest anyone thinks that they don't care for that; and they compete with one another which one will better outboris every boris in politics.</p>

Almost all of our papers are right wing but the Mail is the only one I'd consider ultra-right.

It's really hard for me to articulate the depth of my frustration watching the consequences of the undermining of the higher education system in the UK of play out.

<p>I don't know if this is actually right, but in my mind this is the flip side of Blair's famous target to get 50% of young people in higher education. That target was eventually reached (but during the next government, the Cameron-Clegg one, IIRC). The new funding system designed to handle that load is failing; I suspect the old system of direct funding would have failed even harder. 50% of young people in higher education seems to be right on the edge of what's economically and politically possible in the context we have</p>

<p>The first thing is it represents people willing to pay £30 / month membership fee, which isn't exactly cheap for a PhD student</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UCU membership is free for all students (including PhD students), but still I think uptake is low. I only joined when there was a strike about to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a sliding scale of subscriptions for non-students, too, so someone working part-time (for example) won't be paying £30 per month. In fact only those earning &gt;£60k pay the maximal national sub of £27.50ish per month, but some branches do have a local sub on top.</p>
<p>The UCU does represent some admin and professional services staff but in many institutions those staff will also have representation from another union such as Unison or Unite, which will typically also represent the people who clean the floors, etc, IF those people are employed by the university, which of course is far from guaranteed to be the case.</p>

<p>I can say that when someone mentions Adelaide Uni in that Reddit thread, and then someone checks the pure maths staff listing .... that page listing our staff is several years out of date,  (the internal server where we had our <em>real</em> website was compromised at some point, and taken away by IT and not returned so far, so we can't even get our flat html out and host it somewhere visible.) </p>
<p>In reality, we don't have 4 full Profs, 1 A/Prof and "11 other researchers",  but: </p>
<p>2 full Profs, <br>
1 Emeritus Prof, <br>
1 A/Prof (a different one) and <br>
5 other permanent staff (one of which is part time, one of which is a "teaching specialist")<br>
There's me as a postdoc still, and maybe 2 or 3 other postdocs?</p>
<p>It's kinda embarrassing, really. I don't think we are going to get any additional permanent staff anytime soon.</p>

<p>Updated on this thread: Leicester UCU have formally called for the university to be "greylisted", ie. a complete boycott of all work involving the university - cancelling seminars, conferences, collaboration on projects etc. That's "action short of strike" and would be the first of a series of escalating sanctions against the university<br>

So the <a href="https://le.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/funded-opportunities/informatics-gta-2021">recently advertised position</a> should be boycotted too?</p>

I wanted to say "sacked" (maybe that's just an Australian term), but there are legal frameworks around these different terms, at least in systems I'm familiar with (getting sacked/fired is for something <em>you</em> do. Getting made redundant is because of something management does).</p>

<p>And an email of Simona was forwarded to the categories list asking people to not say she was fired, for exactly the reason I hint at in my last comment: this term has a particular legal meaning in the UK (and in Australia, too), and it very much doesn't apply here!</p>

<p>In theory, the difference is that "fired" means you're kicked out of your job for doing certain extremely bad things and then somebody else is hired into your job, whereas "made redundant" means that your job itself no longer exists, usually for restructuring/financial reasons. In practice, targeted redunancies are common, for example UCU representatives are being made redundant much more frequently than everyone else. (Which as far as I know is illegal but employers generally get away with it)</p>

<p>This is my understanding of "fired" in American parlance as well. You only say you got "fired" when it's supposedly due to your own screw up. Otherwise you say you got "let go" if it's permanent, and "furloughed" if they could bring you back potentially.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> FWIW that is not what furloughed means. Furloughed usually means the company is forcing you to have something like forced leave without pay but it's never "if they could bring you back", you don't lose or often it's not the case that you are losing your job when you are furloughed. If the company can't recover after a furloughed period THEN it might move to letting people go.</p>

<p>I do agree that the general terms in the American vernacular is "I was fired" or "I was let go". Although in my experience most people will say "I was let go" while others will say "They were fired" for them</p>

<p>Both the people I live with, my sister and my wife, were furloughed during the pandemic. In my wife's case, she would be off for two weeks, then on for two weeks. In my sister's case, she was off for months. They brought her back briefly when they thought things were getting better, and then it got way worse, and they completely closed indefinitely. She was furloughed until she eventually quit because of moving away. So I think it can be a complicated word.</p>

<p>Yes. It ran along the same lines as Scottish Theorem Provers and Scottish Programming Languages Seminar. We lost a bit of momentum when some key energy-inputting people moved away. But now there are new energy-inputting people, so it could be worth another go.</p>

<p>The addition of another important person who is a category theorist but not part of the TCS circuit might be the motivation I need to get out and start pushing</p>

<p>It's inappropriate but I'm afraid irresistable to quote Hilbert: "There is no mathematics department in Göttingen"</p>

<p>I'd like to revive this topic in light of the fact that I just received an advert for job positions at the University of Leicester's "School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences" via the Category Theory mailing list, and it includes the quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The excellence of the School’s research has been confirmed in the last two national research assessment exercises (in 2008 and 2014). In each exercise, 95% of our research was judged to be of international quality, 65% was judged to be internationally leading, and over 20% of our research outputs world-leading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what the result of a 'national research assessment exercise' would be today...</p>

<p>Decades from now they will still be touting their greatness in 2008 and 2014, like a tourist brochure advertising the beauty of Mariupol.</p>

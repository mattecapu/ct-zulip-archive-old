<p>Hi everybody, I hope this isn't off-topic. I've been teaching a category theory class this semester in the computer science department at the University of Michigan (<a href="http://maxsnew.com/teaching/eecs-598-w22/">http://maxsnew.com/teaching/eecs-598-w22/</a>) and for the last lecture I want to provide the students with some advertisements for different areas that they should now be empowered to explore on their own.</p>
<p>In the course, I've focused on mostly "programming language" examples, such as simply typed lambda calculus, Lawvere's fixed point theorem, Hoare Logic, logical relations, and monads. For my final lecture I plan to put brief pointers to dependent/homotopy type theory, polymorphism using reflexive graph categories, linear/substructural logic as monoidal categories/multicategories and its influence on languages like Rust, probabilistic programming using sheaves, as well  as my own research on gradual typing and call-by-push-value.</p>
<p>So are there any suggestions for other topics to briefly cover? Shameless self-promotion is completely encouraged!</p>

<p>Ok, shameless self-promotion then: Peio Borthelle, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276696">@Ambroise</span> Lafont, and I used category theory to prove <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02966439v5">a general congruence theorem for applicative bisimilarity</a>, recasting and generalising Howe's standard format in terms of cellularity.</p>
<p>There is also the literature on high-level constructions for syntax with variable binding. E.g., a recent, impressive achievement is <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="358258">@Daniel Gratzer</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="297784">@Jon Sterling</span>'s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10783">method for presenting type theories</a>. Or the <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03633933">preprint</a> I recently advertised here.</p>
<p>Finally, let's ping <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275900">@Stelios Tsampas</span>, who might have something to add.</p>

<p>Thanks for the assist <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="383799">@Tom Hirschowitz</span>. </p>
<p>Hey Max :). Since you're going to mention DTT and HTT, how about pointing them towards Agda, it's CT library and it's cubical version? And then coalgebras, they're a natural fit with computer science, right?</p>

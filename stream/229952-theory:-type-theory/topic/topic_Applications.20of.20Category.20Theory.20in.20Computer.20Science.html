<p>Hi everybody, I hope this isn't off-topic. I've been teaching a category theory class this semester in the computer science department at the University of Michigan (<a href="http://maxsnew.com/teaching/eecs-598-w22/">http://maxsnew.com/teaching/eecs-598-w22/</a>) and for the last lecture I want to provide the students with some advertisements for different areas that they should now be empowered to explore on their own.</p>
<p>In the course, I've focused on mostly "programming language" examples, such as simply typed lambda calculus, Lawvere's fixed point theorem, Hoare Logic, logical relations, and monads. For my final lecture I plan to put brief pointers to dependent/homotopy type theory, polymorphism using reflexive graph categories, linear/substructural logic as monoidal categories/multicategories and its influence on languages like Rust, probabilistic programming using sheaves, as well  as my own research on gradual typing and call-by-push-value.</p>
<p>So are there any suggestions for other topics to briefly cover? Shameless self-promotion is completely encouraged!</p>

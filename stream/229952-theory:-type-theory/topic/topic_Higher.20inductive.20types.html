<p>As far as I can see, the HoTT book gives two applications of higher inductive types in normal (i.e., non-homotopical) math: the construction of the Cauchy reals and the construction of the surreal numbers. Both definitions use the principle of "inductive-inductive" definitions as well. I wonder: Is this really an application of <em>higher</em> inductive types? After all, both definitions contain only point and path constructors, but not any homotopy constructors. So would both definitions also work in, say, a type theory with a notion of "quotient type" and inductive-inductive definitions?<br>
Also, aren't Theorem 11.3.9 and Corollary 11.6.5 (stating that these types are sets) trivial in some sense, because both definitions contain only point and path constructors, but not any homotopy constructors?<br>
The introduction to chapter 6 gives an explanation of the phenomenon of an inductive type being a higher groupoid while being defined only using point and path constructors: if the domain of some constructor has higher paths, these will carry over. But if all domains of all constructors are sets, I believe this can't happen. Do Theorem 11.3.9 and Corollary 11.6.5 also fall in some class of higher inductive types that yield sets "for trivial reasons"?</p>

<p>What's the difference between a "path constructor" and a "homotopy constructor"?</p>

<p>It seems like the circle-as-inductive-type (section 6.4) is a counterexample to your claim, right?</p>

<p>I call the things between points "paths" and the things between paths "homotopies" (but not "paths" anymore).<br>
I don't know what claim you are referring to, because I asked a lot of things. :-)</p>

<p>IIRC, you can recover a similar theorem if you prove that the path constructors are cycle-free. That is, consider a higher inductive type <code>T</code> generated from constructors <code>point : P → T</code> and <code>path : (x y : P) → R x y → point x = point y</code>, where <code>P : Set</code> and <code>R : P → P → Prop</code>. Then, if <code>R</code> is cycle-free in some suitable graph-theoretic sense, <code>T</code> will be a set. The circle fails the latter condition in the simplest way possible – the whole idea of the circle is that the path forms a cycle.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate a reference, if anyone knows one, because it's not immediately clear to me how it works when <code>P</code> has large cardinality and cycle-free paths can be infinitely long.</p>

<p>For the broader question, <em>quotient inductive-inductive types</em> have been studied. As far as I can tell, the Cauchy reals are a prime motivating example, along with similar cases where QIITs are enough to get around countable choice.</p>

<p>Note that the Cauchy reals and surreals are not just a combination of quotient types with ordinary inductive-inductive types; it matters greatly that the quotienting is <em>part</em> of the inductive definition.  In particular, both quotients and ordinary inductive-inductive definitions exist in ZF, but quotient inductive types don't in general.</p>

<p>The example of the circle might suggest that at least a HIT with only 0- and 1-dimensional constructors whose domains are all sets ought to be a 1-type.  In higher dimensions the analogous fact becomes wildly false, e.g. the 2-sphere has only 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional constructors, but is certainly not a 2-type or even an n-type for any finite n.  The 1-dimensional case is true <em>classically</em>, and also in every Grothendieck-Lurie <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-topos, but I believe it's still an open question in constructive HoTT whether, for instance, the suspension of a set is always a 1-type.</p>

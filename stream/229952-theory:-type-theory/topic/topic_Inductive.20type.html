<p>The HoTT book (specifically chapter 5) acts like there is a concept of "inductive type", of which the notion of a "W-type" is a special case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far, we have been discussing only particular inductive types: 0, 1, 2, N, coproducts, products, Σ-types, W-types, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would be an example of an inductive type that is not a W-type? I always thought of "W-type" as an already quite general notion of the idea of an "inductive type".</p>

<p>I think that categorical models of relational databases are a nice complement to PLT applications for a CT in CS course. One can put bells and whistles on it, but the basic model of Spivak's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1166">functorial data migration</a> is pleasingly simple: database schemas are finitely presented categories and database instances are set-valued functors (copresheaves) on the schema. With this setup, there is a dictionary between many standard CT and database concepts.</p>

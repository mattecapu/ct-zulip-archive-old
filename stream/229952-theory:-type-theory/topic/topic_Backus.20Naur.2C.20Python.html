<p>Curious if there’s a dense, pure definition of category theoretic objects as a tight, rigorous language - could be like an extended Bacchus Naur Form description of category theory, axiomatically / as a formal language?</p>
<p>I’m personally try to make sure I have some basic definitions solidified. Seven Sketches of Compositionality, the book I’m working with, does not provide definitions of sets or logical concepts, beyond “a collection of things”.</p>
<p>But my early attempt would be something like this (maybe to come, in Python).</p>
<p>We could take the Python set object as the mathematical concept of a set. To add structure we can define new classes.</p>
<p>What might a list of definitions look like?</p>
<p>We probably need products and subsets next?</p>
<p>Products are tuples in Python.</p>
<p>A subset is a set, the parent / superset set, and the “subset function” that tests the truth condition “is subset”: so its signature is actually a triple, A, B, f. Right? def subset(A, B): condition = False; for element in B: if element not in A: condition = False; return condition</p>
<p>I imagine there’s a more pythonic way using a list processing method like a map or filter or something.</p>
<p>And then? I’ll see what is needed next. I know a relation is actually a subset of a product set. A function is a relation with a certain condition expressed in logical quantifiers, I think? two sets A B, for each b in B, there exists one and only one a in A such that the tuple in the subset of the product set of A and B has b in second place.</p>
<p>So we skipped over sets and logic, but it doesn’t matter since we already roughly have it in Python. We define a preorder as a binary relation which is reflexive and transitive. Like subsets, perhaps, all concepts can be defined as a signature of objects <em>and</em> functions they have to pass - their conditions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dependently typed language such as FOLDS , which was already mentioned above, the concepts category, object and morphism are primitives and you don't have to ever say "set" in such a language if you don't want to. You can of course add a category "Set" to such a language and axiomatise some of its categorical properties in the spirit of ETCS for example.</p>

<p>I'm changing the title of this post from "Bacchus Naur" to "Backus Naur" even though I <em>really love</em> the idea that the Roman god of wine and festivity has a computer science concept named after him.</p>

<p>heh, there's always the "Ballmer peak": <a href="https://xkcd.com/323/">https://xkcd.com/323/</a></p>

<p>I don't mean to pick on your choice of example but Python is not a good choice of formal language to make this comparison. Python, like Javascript or other interpreted scripting languages, is a very rich and complex language to the point where giving a semantics for it is impossible. If you try to translate math into Python to make it more rigorous, you will quickly run into the problem that Python itself is not very rigorous.</p>
<p>It would be better for you to look into other formal languages like ZFC set theory, higher order logic (see "Simple Type Theory" by W. Farmer),  dependent type theory ("Type theory and formal proof" by Geuvers and Nederpelt)<br>
 Coq, Agda, Lean, etc. But really an informal mathematical book on set theory like the one by Halmos would be more practical.</p>

<p>There's also recent work by New and Licata: <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30829-1_6">A Formal Logic for Formal Category Theory</a>.</p>

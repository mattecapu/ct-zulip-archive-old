<p>Hi, I keep coming back to the following question and I can't seem to find good references.</p>
<p>Given a monad T, there are some well known conditions (necessary and sufficient, I think) on the monad to let you interpret its category of algebras in various type theories:</p>
<p>Strong monad -&gt; Moggi's monadic metalanguage/Call-by-push-value<br>
Commutative monad -&gt; Symmetric monoidal categories/linear logic w/ just exchange</p>
<p>And furthermore if T is the monad from an algebraic theory there are conditions on the theory that are equivalent to the conditions on the monad:</p>
<p>Strong monad -&gt; any theory <br>
Commutative monad -&gt; commutative theory (all operations commute)</p>
<p>Can anyone help me find a reference for the two intermediate notions:<br>
?? theory -&gt; ?? monad -&gt; semicartesian monoidal category/affine logic (linear logic + weakening)<br>
?? theory -&gt; ?? monad -&gt; relevance monoidal category/relevance logic (linear logic + contraction)</p>
<p>I could have sworn I've seen them before, but I am coming up empty. I'd like to put them on nlab so I don't lose them again.</p>

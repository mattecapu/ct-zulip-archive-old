<p>I'm reading "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08054">Information-theoretic foundations of thermodynamics in general probabilistic theories</a>", which is Carlo Maria Scandolo's PhD thesis, and it discusses operational probabilistic theories from (what I as a category theorist) would say is an informal perspective. Other papers that I've looked at on the subject have a similar lack of formalization. Is there any treatment that you all know of that pins down exactly what type of category an operational probabilistic theory is? And also writes down what would be functors between such theories?</p>

<p>I'm teaching a private student some probability theory from a sophisticated point of view, and I was wondering what would be the cleanest way to construct the product measure, on the product of probability spaces. Getting the product of measurable spaces (I.e. only the data of the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebras) is ok, but the first resources I've been looking at have been relying on a general result about extending a pre-measure like the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem or Carathéodory's extension theorem. Is there a cleaner proof in the case of forming a product space? Obviously we can't get away from analysis completely, since we need to use completeness of the reals somewhere, I presume.</p>

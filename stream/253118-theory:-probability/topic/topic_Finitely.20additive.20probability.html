<p>I've been idly wondering about finitely additive probability, which is just probability theory minus the axiom that the probability of a countable union of pairwise disjoint sets has to equal the sum of the probabilities of the individual sets. (Hence, I think, it can be defined in terms of atomic Boolean algebras instead of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>−</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma-</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">σ</span><span class="mord">−</span></span></span></span> algebras.) There's a paper about its implications here:</p>
<p>Kadane, Schervish and Seidenfeld (1986) <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/seidenfeld/Stat%20implications%20FA.pdf">Statistical Implications of Finitely Additive Probability</a></p>
<p>I'm wondering if it's been studied from the perspective of category-theoretic probability. For example, if one defined a monad of finitely additive probability measures and took its Kleisli category, would that result in a 'nicer' Markov category than the one you get from normal, countably additive probability measures? Given such a category of finitely additive Markov kernels, is there a category-theoretic way to extract the ones that are also countably additive?</p>
<p>It seems like often this kind of generalisation is worthwhile in category theory, so I wondered if this particular one has been studied.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever looked into Markov categories that are also traced monoidal, describing steady states of Markov chains?</p>

<p>This seems to me like a Thing That Ought To Be Done</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="499481">@Mateo Torres-Ruiz</span> and I were just wondering about this! A first (unsatisfactory) answer is that you can embed the category of stochastic maps into that of linear maps with the tensor as monoidal product, which is traced, at least in the finite-dimensional case---I'll let people that are knowledgeable in functional analysis tell us how to generalise this to infinite dimensions. But I suppose the (partial) trace of a stochastic map might not be stochastic, which is why I said that was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>And this might not be the sort of trace you want if steady states of Markov chains is what you're studying. You'd prefer some <em>additive</em> (particle-style in GoI terms?) trace, computed as the sum of iterated powers of your stochastic matrix.</p>

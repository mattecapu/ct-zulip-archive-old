<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I just posted the new preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07028">Operads as double functors</a>, <br>
which may be partly considered as an indexed (instead of fibered) version of the previous <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01967">Fibered multicategory theory</a>.<br>
The main achievement is the characterization of colored operads  (that is, symmetric multicategories) <br>
as product-preserving double (lax) functors from the opposite of the double category of pullback squares in finite sets <br>
to the double category of mappings and spans in sets; <br>
or, equivalently, as <em>normal</em>  product-preserving double (lax) functors from the same double category<br>
 to that of functors and profunctors.<br>
This may be seen as a generalization of the characterization of commutative monoids <br>
as product-preserving double functors from the opposite of the double category of pullback squares in finite sets <br>
to the double category of squares in sets.<br>
This view suggests the concept of generalized operad (and of generalized commutative monoid) <br>
obtained by replacing, in the above, the category of finite sets with any category C. <br>
For instance, if A is a category with small products (or sums) one gets a generalized operad with C = Set,<br>
and by taking its isomorphism classes one gets the corresponding generalized monoid.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to receiving your feedback!</p>

<p>Does this perspective shed any light on two-sided multicategory-like structures such as polycategories or props?</p>

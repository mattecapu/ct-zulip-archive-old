<p>My paper on topological monoids is finally complete!</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00772">https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00772</a></p>
<p>The purpose of this paper was to answer the basic questions about toposes of actions of topological monoids on sets. Its introduction gives a more detailed account, but here is an overview of the questions that were answered.</p>
<p>Are these categories of actions necessarily toposes? (Yes!)<br>
What properties do they have?<br>
Are they Grothendieck toposes; in particular, can we find natural sites for them? (Yes and yes!)<br>
When are two such toposes equivalent; that is, when are two topological monoids Morita equivalent?<br>
What information about the topological monoid can we recover from the topos if we are given its underlying discrete monoid? (We obtain a canonical coarsest topology on that monoid.)<br>
What can we say about the topological properties of the representative monoids we get out of that process?<br>
What about if we are only given the forgetful functor to the topos of sets? (We obtain a representing topological monoid built from the natural endomorphisms of the forgetful functor.)<br>
Can we characterize these toposes? (Yes, in terms of their points.)<br>
Do continuous monoid homomorphisms (or semigroup homomorphisms) produce geometric morphisms between these toposes? (Yes!)<br>
If so, can we use these to characterize Morita equivalence between these toposes? (Alas, no!)</p>
<p>All questions and feedback are welcomed.</p>

<p>I have a couple of questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For which kind of  topological algebraic structure X (topological magmas, topological semigroups semigroups...) we have that Cont(X,Set) is a topos? Are groups and monoids somewhat special?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a bit confused by your Cor. 1.18. It is known that every topos with enogh points E is equivalent to Cont(G,Set), for some topological group G (this is really Galois(-Lascar) theory at the end of the day, G can be choosen to be the automorphism group of a saturated enough model). I must be superficial, but this sounds in contradiction with your 1.18 to me.</p>

<ol>
<li>The proof that these are toposes in the monoid and group cases rests on the fact that the forgetful functor to Sets is (conservative and) the inverse image functor of a point of these toposes. I make the remark in the paper that you can extend a topological semigroup to a topological monoid (by freely adding an open identity element) without changing the category of continuous actions, so you get that the actions of those are toposes. For a topological magma, the fact that you have to map into the endomorphism monoid of a set to get an action means that you're going to factor through the associative reflection anyhow, so I'm pretty sure the same story will happen, but for less interesting reasons. Monoids are kind of the universal case of this, by virtue of actions on sets involving mapping into endomorphism monoids.</li>
<li>Every topos with enough points is the topos of actions of some topological <em>groupoid</em>. Asking that this be a group is a rather extreme restriction, since it forces the topos to be atomic.</li>

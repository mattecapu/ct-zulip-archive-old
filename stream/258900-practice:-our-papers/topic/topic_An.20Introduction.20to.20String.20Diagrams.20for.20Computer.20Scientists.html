<p>Often, when undergraduate and graduate students in CS are assigned their first project involving string diagrams, or simply express curiosity about the subject, they find themselves wondering where to start. With <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="351836">@Fabio Zanasi</span>, we wrote this introduction to provide a starting point (which grew out of notes designed to onboard students in our own research). The idea is to offer a glimpse into the state of research with string diagrams in 2023. </p>
<p>It is first draft---we eagerly welcome comments and feedback to improve its content!</p>

<p>This is sure exciting! I'll give it a read at some point! In your opinion, for a CS student, what would be their expected/recommended background with understanding string diagrams (like perhaps in terms of prior classes, exposures to ideas, etc.)? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277342">@Robin Piedeleu</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="351836">@Fabio Zanasi</span> ?</p>

<p>It really depends under which perspective string diagrams are introduced. The way we do it in this paper, it is useful to be familiar with how the syntax of a programming language is presented via BNF/grammars. Also knowing what 'operational semantics' and 'denotational semantics' of a PL is helps. Finally, exposure to some basic algebra of datatypes (which may come from Haskell for instance, but also from a basic course on groups/monoids etc.)</p>

<p>I would say though that, at least for the first few pages, we try not to assume anything without at least reminding the reader first.</p>

<p>An incredibly tiny comment: where you say "certain areas of computer science, such as quantum theory" it might be better to say "such as quantum computation" or something like that, because the current phrasing suggests that quantum theory is (merely?) an area of computer science, which will shock some physicists.   I know that's not what you meant, but people have an amazing ability to misread things.</p>

<p>Another equally tiny, nitpicky comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having products is a <em>property</em> of a category.  A monoidal product, on the other hand, is a <em>structure</em> over a category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great point to make.  I think the correct phrasing is "structure <strong>on</strong> a category".</p>

<p>I have some memory of a (famous?) computer scientist remarking during a talk that mathematics is a branch of computer science</p>

<p>A couple of things I found missing while skimming through.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to see simple examples of proofs using diagrammatic reasoning. You explain the idea in Remark 2.13, but I would also like several simple examples like proving that left unitality + commutativity implies right unitality in the theory of commutative monoids. Carefully expliciting alI the steps and possibly comparing them to the steps in the  derivation using equational reasoning could help. Even in that simple proof, the sliding of the unit has raised questions when I showed it once because of the invisible wire. I think it would be nice to have 1 or 2 more examples.</li>
<li>I would like the software list to also have typesetting software/libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was reading up on critical brain hypothesis , and as a preliminary set-up I defined the following  Markov Process. After <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> 's talk today  , does anyone feel that this formulation can be taken forward, and studied. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="319149">@Nivedita</span> This isn't exactly the same thing, but Erhesmann and Gomez-Ramirez (and others) have been working on a categorical theory of neural architecture for a very, very long time. Here's a link to a good overview paper:</p>

<p>It feels like there should be lots of opportunity for cross-polination among these topics:<br>
(1) Markov Categories,<br>
(2) Petri Nets<br>
And (3) MENS (Erhesmann et al)</p>

<p>Hi! Yes, I have closely been following Erhesmann and Gomez-Ramirez (his book was good too <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5">https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5</a>) As you said they have been trying for very very long. <br>
But, Critical brain hypothesis hasn't been discussed in their work. This is more Physics-y recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04353">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04353</a> but no one applied CT in this approach. That is what I was thinking vaguely about, starting with a Markov or generalized Markov process.</p>

<p>Can you point me to any groups (and places) actively trying to do this 'cross-pollination' :)  That would help.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="319149">@Nivedita</span>, I don't know of anybody actively researching these connections, but there are several running threads about Markov Categories and Petri Nets scattered about (it's probably easiest to just search for the terms). As for MENS, I haven't heard a peep about it from anybody since I joined the Zulip. I'm personally still building up to being able to fully understand a lot of their work.</p>

<p>As for the critical brain hypothesis stuff, this is very interesting. Thanks for the reference!</p>
<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277446">@David Jaz</span>'s work on dynamical systems may be relevant in that it is general enough to talk about the idea while incorperating the structures from MENS. Though this is just a guess.</p>

<p>Ah! I meant groups of people in real life  (thinking about potential grad school places) and also so that I have some one to correspond with since no one around me is working on this right now, I am trying independently.</p>

<p>I think you could also google Karl Friston, and its FEP: Free Energy Principle, besides Markov Blankets..</p>

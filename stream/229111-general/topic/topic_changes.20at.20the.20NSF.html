<p>I just read this, but haven't fully formed my thoughts yet. What do you think?<br>

<p>It's great news for ACT, as there's ACT activity in almost all the focus areas of the new Technology Directorate (TD).</p>

<p>Arden Brement isn't wrong to see the downsides, however: see also the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/us-lawmakers-unveil-bold-100-billion-plan-remake-nsf">report</a> on <em>Science</em>. Since the new TD will have more than 2x the budget of the current NSF, what you may see in the new NSTF is a dominant TD faction over the other non-TDs for the 5 years the $100b is being disbursed. The interim politics over the 5 years may see the non-TD part of NSTF cut down to size.</p>
<p>Once the five years is up or the $100b gets whittled down in the future, what will the situation be then? Going by historical trends, fiscally conservative voices may rise up and demand a budget cut. If they succeed, you may get something like the ARC in Australia, which has a "National Research Priorities" mission similar to the TD's "focus areas", and funds very little curiosity-driven research that doesn't align itself with those priorities (or doesn't already have backing from people who have a good track record of getting funds from the ARC).</p>

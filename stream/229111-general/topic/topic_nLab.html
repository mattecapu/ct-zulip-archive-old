<p>I guess everyone here is at least aware that nLab has been having technical difficulties in the last months. But I only just saw these words written by Urs: (<a href="http://128.2.67.219/schreiber/show/What+is...+the+nLab#fn:1">http://128.2.67.219/schreiber/show/What+is...+the+nLab#fn:1</a>)</p>
<p>"The operation of the main web of the nnLab had been abruptly suspended on 29 Dec. 2021 by its single volunteer installation administrator at that time, without notice or discussion. (The forum page with the shutdown announcement is now down, too.) Authors have been locked out of all their pages since (in particular I continue being locked out of my home page, please check by email whether information given there is still accurate, in case it matters).<br>
The currently remaining rudimentary page display is hence outdated, besides having been partially broken in the shutdown process; and readers should please beware that the nnLab pages they currently get to see have not been, are not being and cannot be maintained until further notice. (Some pages are not even displaying their latest content as of the shutdown moment anymore.)<br>
Requests to at least post an alert to this effect on displayed pages have been turned down without reason; and a succession of announcements of system recovery have all passed without effect, instead further functionality has been switched off since. In short, the nnLab installation has de facto died on 29 Dec. 2021, and it is unclear if or when it will be revived in the future, and in which state of coherence or trustworthiness. Myself, I have unfortunately no control or command over the installation, having trusted in volunteer help on this crucial point.<br>
A hard restart of the entire nnLab project seems to be necessary, and maybe there is some value to this, dire as it feels at this point. If anyone reading this sees themselves willing and capable to set up, host and administrate a research wiki vaguely like the nnLab was, possibly better, then please contact me."</p>

<p>The important thing isn't not to rely on volunteers, but insofar as possible not to rely.  The main thing is to have a process by which the service can be set up again without help from whoever is currently running it, like always having up-to-date backups in the hands of the wiki administrators (and if possible, slightly-less-up-to-date backups available to the general public).</p>

<p>Putting someone to work on this means paying someone part-time to do it. At least for a startup-like reality, this is just not possible. Also I wouldn't be too happy knowing that ncatlab is privately managed.</p>

<p>The best strategy imho would be to request some sort of grant for this task, and use that money to pay some freelance professional to take care of it. Also, I'd request monthly or at least quarterly backups so that if something like this happens again in the future the project can be restarted easily. I really hope Urs has some backups of the ncatlab.</p>

<p>29 Dec 2021 is a long time ago, and the nLab has been "running" much more recently than that.  I suggest asking Urs whether that quoted text is just an out-of-date leftover.</p>
<p>However, I do certainly agree that the reliance on the current volunteer labor is a bad situation, for many reasons.</p>

<p>Ah, reading more closely I see that Urs is referring to the shutdown of <em>editing</em>, which has indeed been going on that long.  I wish I were able to help with solving the problem myself, but I have too much on my plate at the moment already.</p>
<p>I do think that there are backups of the page source, in at least some form.  My personal workstation has been running daily backups for a while, and I think Urs and possibly one or two others also have.  It looks like they stopped working this March, but I still have backups from December, January, and February -- I haven't looked at them, but the gzipped files are 1.2G, so they have <em>something</em> in them.</p>

<p>Industry usually gives money to develop things. You finance an institute or a startup to get a slice of the possible earnings. From this point of view financing the nlab is a bit of a dead end: It is not intrinsically novel per sé, it's just a repository. Industry investors have little incentives to invest in something like this instead of moving their money towards something that deliver novel, exploitable research. The only incentive I can think of is philanthropy, which is a very rare thing to find lol</p>

<p>Clearly if something like the Topos Institute acquires a staggering valuation, then they could use part of the money to maintain the nlab. The problem is getting to that valuation. Almost all startups in this space are pretty early on, in a stage where every penny counts <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Richard estimates that costs will be &lt; $6 a month (<a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13776/nlab-migration-to-the-cloud/?Focus=97893#Comment_97893">https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13776/nlab-migration-to-the-cloud/?Focus=97893#Comment_97893</a>). So securing funding is not a top priority.</p>
<p>Urs seems to be being overly dramatic about the whole thing. This migration was necessary to create the kind of robust technology for the nLab that we all want. It's now running on AWS; whereas before it was running on a single box in someone's office. The plan is also to open-source all the code.</p>
<p>Also, the search is now infinitely faster than it was before, which anyone who experienced the old search will know is an absolute blessing.</p>

<p>I'd guess the nForum is probably down for an unrelated reason; I just checked that the nCafe has no post about the nLab's technical problems, so probably this very thread is 3rd in line to the throne of places that anyone can even talk about this.

<p>Sure. And Urs' post made some sense when he originally made it. I just don't understand why he's sounding the alarm again by retweeting it now that most of the trouble is over. It's lead to a post on reddit declaring 'Apparently nLab is dead' at the top of r/math with 105 votes. This is frustrating because it will discourage people from interacting with the nLab at exactly the moment when editing is being reopened.</p>

<p>Right, I can still post there by telling my browser to access it anyway. (For some reason my phone gives me this option but my laptop does not.)</p>

<p>Most modern browsers will refuse to allow you to visit a site with an expired certificate nowadays.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I just opened my personal laptop and I have that button. So this is a recent change to Firefox, they took that button away, presumably so that anyone capable of finding and carrying out the override instructions is more likely to understand the risks</p>

<p>I'd guess the nForum is probably down for an unrelated reason; I just checked that the nCafe has no post about the nLab's technical problems, so probably this very thread is 3rd in line to the throne of places that anyone can even talk about this. (Which isn't ideal because Urs himself isn't signed up here, I think)</p>

<p>Urs quit posting on the nCafe years ago, so any such post would most likely emanate from Mike Shulman or David Corfield.</p>

<p>I tried going to the nForum.  I got a warning about an expired security certificate on my up-to-date Firefox 99.0.1 (64-bit Windows version).  It allowed me to take a chance and go ahead.    It works fine.</p>

<p>Maybe you folks already know this, but the security certificate on the nForum has expired. Thus, my Firefox browser warned me not to go ahead and visit these sites... but I said I was willing to take the risk and went ahead. Other less brave users think something really bad has happened.</p>

<p>There have been a number of assurances from Richard that editing functionality will be available by such-and-such date, but it seems the goalposts keep getting moved. I assume that and the licensing problem with the nForum are the things frustrating Urs. (And him above anyone else, since he had made the nLab inseparable from his research life.)</p>

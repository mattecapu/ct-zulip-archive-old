<p>It's not exactly a new journal - more like a new <em>subjournal</em> of <em>Theory and Applications of Categories</em>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editors of TAC (Theory and Applications of Categories) are pleased to announce a new series of the journal entitled "TAC Expositions".  This is a separate series from the standard journal, with a specific focus on expository articles in the theory and applications of categories.  The editorial policy of the new series states:</p>
<p>"Expositions in Theory and Applications of Categories ('TAC Expositions') is a special series specifically designed for publication of well-written and novel expository articles on topics of current research interest in the theory and/or applications of categories.  While a TAC Exposition article need not include new results, it must be novel in either its arrangement or viewpoint, providing a new perspective or context for known results.  Authors considering submitting an expository paper are advised to consult an editor on its suitability for TAC Expositions."</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/expositions/index.html">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/expositions/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your contributions for this new series!</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Geoff Cruttwell<br>
TAC Managing Editor</p>

<p>This is great! I've also been thinking for a while CT needs expository articles of the same level as <a href="https://distill.pub/">https://distill.pub/</a> I really hope to get around to doing something like this, eventually...</p>

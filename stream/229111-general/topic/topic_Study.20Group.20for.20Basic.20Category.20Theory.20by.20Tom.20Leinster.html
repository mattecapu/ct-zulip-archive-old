<p>Hello, friends. I was wondering if there are any newcomers to Category Theory that would be interested in a study group of the book Basic Category Theory by Tom Leinster. The goal would not be to go over the theory, but to solve the exercises in the book and come up with a solution's manual by the end.<br>
I've already got some of the gist of CT by reading "Category Theory for the Sciences" and now I'm trying to tackle more mathy exercises.<br>
If there are people interested, I'll create a topic in the "learning: reading groups" stream.</p>

<p>My student <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> is working with an undergrad, Sadaf Kadir, on a project involving 2d TQFT.  I'm wondering if anyone has looked at the partition function as a function of genus and differentiated it with respect to the genus.  This is a strange thing to do since the genus takes integer values... but in the limit of large genus it should make sense and have some physical meaning: derivatives of the partition function tend to be important in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Probably someone <em>has</em> done this before... and that's okay, because this project doesn't need to be original research.  But I'm wondering about the physical interpretation.  For example <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321388900971">Coleman</a> did calculations involving a 'gas of virtual wormholes', claiming to show this drives the cosmological constant down to zero.  There might be a lower-dimensional (and purely topological) analogue of that here.</p>

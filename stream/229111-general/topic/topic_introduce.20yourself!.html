<p>Hello! I'm brand new to this website and still figuring things out. I am a phd student working on philosophy of physics stuff.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Srikanth and I am a Ph.D student from India. I joined as a physics student but I am working with a mathematician now. I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>
<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! I'm a PhD student in aerospace engineering. My research is in stochastic dynamical systems, and I'm trying to create <a href="https://github.com/drewmcneely/girypy">a library</a> to represent control and estimation schemes using Markov categories. I asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276702">@Tobias Fritz</span> for some help, and in our discussions he suggested I check this place out.</p>
<p>There's a lot I want to do with this library, but I'm just starting to expose myself to the work that others have done in monoidal categories. I'm hoping I can utilize some of it!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309295">@Dario Stein</span> This is super interesting! Do you plan on extending to other Markov categories aside from <strong>Gauss</strong>? That's what I'm trying to do currently, but I often get stuck.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm a Postdoc in graph theory and computational complexity who's recently started to transition into applied category theory. </p>
<p>I work on structural graph theory (mostly) and I study so called 'recursive graph decompositions' (i.e. tree-width, clique-width etc etc). Lately my work has started to focus on categorical characterizations and generalizations of these graph-theoretic notions. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool that this community exists, so thanks for having me! I look forward to meeting you all :)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="481356">@Benjamin Merlin Bumpus</span>. There was recently some discussion about if/how category theory might be applied to graph theory <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/enriched.20graphs">here</a>.

<p>Hi everyone!<br>
My name is Jacob Zelko and I am a researcher at Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control.<br>
I have formal training in biomedical engineering, biomedical informatics, and medical anthropology and currently serve as the PI in an observational health characterization study.</p>
<p>I was exposed almost by chance to Category Theory through working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> and other members of the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
I was greatly smitten by the ideas in CT as I had been thinking for several years about knowledge management and information systems - going so far as to read some old papers pertaining to cybernetics and control theory.<br>
When I stumbled across CT, it just made complete sense and I was sold on the idea as it helped me put in order my thoughts on relating the typically unrelatable.<br>
Currently, my interest in Category Theory lies in determining how to compose research studies in order to create novel research studies - especially in the domain of observational and public health research. </p>
<p>As an aside, I have a vested interest in visualization as I am the co-creator of the <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Julia Animation and Visualization engine, Javis.jl</a>, and am currently exploring methods of creating a tool to create commonly used visualizations in CT research through my <a href="https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/LuxCat.jl/">small side project, LuxCat.jl</a>, while interoperating within the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
Furthermore, I am the author of a small website called <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/C3T">Crash Course Category Theory (C3T for short)</a> that contains my notes as a non-mathematician learning CT.</p>
<p>Pleasure to be here!</p>
<p>P.S.  For fun, here is an animation of an upcoming feature made by a Javis contributor named John and an example of a diagram representing a simple ACSet defined in Julia!</p>

<p>Hi I'm Miguel, or rather MA, for short. My life started high in energy (Math. Physics) and I've been gradually radiating off on my way through Stat Mech, Biology and now working in IT. I never found the right/enough time to learn beyond the basics of CT and I'm hoping being here around reading and possibly asking questions may help me get beyond that 101 level. So thanks for having this running and being welcoming.</p>

<p>Hello!   Right now you can watch a bunch of us talking about chemistry and category theory at <a class="stream" data-stream-id="322714" href="/#narrow/stream/322714-practice.3A-chemistry">#practice: chemistry</a>.   We're just getting started; we'll be meeting at the end of May to work on this.</p>
<p>There's a lot of other stuff going on here, too.   I guess you need to subscribe to streams to see what's going on in those streams.</p>

<p>John Baez sent me an invite, and here I am.  In my retirement from the military-industrial-intelligence complex, I am looking into understanding the universe as it really is and not as one would like it to be.  Discovered The Laws of Form while reviewing Stan Tenen's book "The Alphabet that Changed the World."  Discovered Burkhard Heim's Extended Quantum Field Theory, and then his Theory of Everything, and realized that the Laws of Form provided the axioms for Heim's Theory.  It has been a wild ride since then.  Just came to the understanding that, as George Spencer-Brown wrote, if something is obvious from experience, but very hard to prove, then it is probably very close to an axiom of the real world.  Turns out the Jordan Curve Theorem is hard to prove because it is a statement of the definition of a distinction in the Laws of Form.  This turns topology on its head, and means that the world is quantized by area.</p>

<p>Hi there everyone! I'm Jake! I've been into categories since I feel in love with algebraic topology, and naturally found myself diving deep through the nLabyrinths. I've been influenced by the ideas of too many of the incredible names I see in this chat. I've been hoping to join for a long time, and it's a pleasure to be invited here. Thank you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281272">@Sam Tenka</span> ! I am also a friend of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="332609">@Dean Young</span> , who I see just joined too.</p>
<p>My main interests are spread all over all the places. Haha... but lately I have been thinking about 'everything classifies something', univalence, holography, modulation, modality (cohesion etc), tangles, cobordisms, groupoidification, species, Goodwillie, Chu and (co)bar stuff, coends, 'tensorality'. Idk, just kind of my palette of ideas, connotations and contexts.</p>
<p>I have a strong desire to see stuff synthesized, and I contemplate my measures of pleasures in these syntheses. I think about variation–integration in analogy to analysis–synthesis, and I wonder if higher (co)monadic, spherical diagrams and their duals can capture nestings of modalities. I use cooking metaphors a lot, like 'this geometry tastes spicy and slightly under-baked'. (Sidenote: do you think we might benefit from topologizing qualia? It might taste good idk/lol)</p>

<p>Haha, neither am I really. What kinds of shapes of qualities do all 'tensor things' share? That would be my initial qualification of the neologism, beyond it having a slight ring to it. Maybe 'tensorality' is better, or just different. But I do think about co-Yoneda and whatever higher double categories should be, and Loregian's(?) 'Einstein notation for profunctors'. Can we have 'coordinate-free' functor calculi like how we do coordinate-free differential geometries? Idk, but THAT should be 'tensorious' in my book, hahaha</p>

<p>As I haven't formally introduced myself,Hello there :) My journey into category theory is/was very chaotic - while in the first year of a CS degree I noticed that every seperate topic had 'structures' and 'things going between them' and also bought an ereader so I basicaly burned myself out of uni (which i was doing better than school at) by going deep into the CT rabbit hole with various branches of math before and after that (information theory for example).one of my favourite subbranches are categorical logic/semantics and internal structures and i've been thinking about how to apply the 'structural' part of category theory to the current wave of machine learning/AI ever since to make it less throw-stuff-at-the wall-and-see-what-sticks.For personal reasons (the burnout being the main one) experimenting with my ideas practically in code is hard for me.Also,sometimes I dip into developing small games or if i get an idea for an interesting mechanic (usually involving some form of procedural generation,one book put it nicely - it feels like you're playing with infinity),but that's just basically developing coalgebras with the players' actions (or lack thereof) as the transitions  :) experimenting with ML is hard cause of the compute requirements but I had some small victories there.Basically currently I'm a madman stuck in the nLabyrinth :D</p>

<p>That was meant to be to seperate things mentioned but since you ask,I have one idea for using discrete AI planning (STRIPS formalism for example) to try to procedurally generate puzzles,quests etc.There's already a paper on this  but not exactly what i have in mind - basically doing the reverse of planning - generate the sequence of actions first (the puzzle,which could be constrained in various ways),and then generate the strating situation in which that plan could be executed.And since planning formalisms are basically a complex labelled transition system (guess) thats the connection with coalgebras :) I already have a very buggy procedurally generated puzzle game up.</p>
<p>coalgebras,as I see them,are an abstraction of moving around a statespace constrained by the actions available.</p>

<p>This is amazing! I dream of an abstract machine that procedurally generates procedural generators, and to describe it using 'higher adjunctions' in (∞,∞)-categories (better names are out there I am sure). But imagine if we could model, say, Dwarf Fortress, using a basis of nice constructor constructors? The 'Calculus of Constructions' has proven very adaptive, I don't see why we can't dream in that direction.</p>

<p>I haven't yet grasped what the two numbers (n,m)-category mean but am familiar with enriched/n-categories.The intuition for adjunctions that finally stuck with me and i wrote about in the 'around machine learning' thread is an information theoretic one,but why do they give rise to (co)monads/nice (co)algebras is still beyond me.Good to know there are people thinking about PCG and CT though :)</p>

<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>My name is Carlos Zapata-Carratala. I finished my PhD in the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh a couple of years ago and I am currently the president of the <a href="https://semf.org.es/">Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research</a> while I continue with my mathematical research and look for postdoc positions. I am currently based between Edinburgh (UK) and Alicante (Spain).</p>
<p>I first came across category theory due to my work in differential geometry and the mathematical foundations of physics. I was introduced to the subject by Tom Leinster and his students here in Edinburgh. I have recently refocused my interest in category theory due to my current research on higher order systems and, in particular, higher arity structures in mathematics, physics and computer science.</p>
<p>The main goals of the higher arity research project (which I lead) are outlined in our website that went online recently:</p>
<p><a href="https://arity.science/">https://arity.science/</a></p>
<p>Athough the project as a whole is highly interdisciplinary in scope (we have collaborators ranging from biology to art history), what pertains to category theory, and the reason I am excited to join this online community, is that we are looking for higher arity generalizations of the basic notion of category. This means, in particular, increasing the number of objects related by morphisms in a way that is generally non-sequential and doesn't necessarily conform to an input-output framework. Notions  such as operads and poly/multicategories (and their higher generalizations) are steps in the right direction for the sort of generalizations that we are searching for, but they are still firmly anchored in sequentiality and input-output, i.e. they are all largely formulable in terms of directed graphs, put simply "they are mostly about arrows". The idea is to take (directed or otherwise) hypergraphs as a starting point for higher arity analogues of category-like objects.</p>
<p>There is some work on this topic of higher arity categories from <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01229967.pdf">Topentcharov</a> in the 1980s but it doesn't seem that much more has been done in that direction. Any pointers to relevant literature are greatly appreciated. We have rediscovered an example of a known structure called a heapoid (a partial ternary operation satisfying a slight modification of associativity) where our approach seems to clarify things greatly and it paves the way to finding meaningful n-ary generalizations of associativity. We describe this in our recent paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05456">Heaps of Fish: arrays, generalized associativity and heapoids</a></p>
<p>Any comments or criticisms are most welcome!</p>

<p>That does follow the general ideas that we are interested in, as I mentioned polycategories are instances of higher arity generalizations of categories. The problem that I see with polycategories is that they are not very "primitive" as n-ary structures in the sense that composition is still a binary operation on morphisms. An easy example of a ternary (pre?)category is the class of sets and ternay relations. If we understand composition as a generalization from binary relations, i.e. an operation that takes several relations of a fixed arity and gives another relation of the same arity (the usual case is a pair of binary relations compose to give another binary relation, which in our eyes is the prime example that motivates the usual definition of composition of morphisms in categories), then there are many posibilities. In section 4.3 of our previous paper we identify at least 10 different well-defined composition operations taking trios of ternary relations on sets: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738</a>. This means that if there exists a satisfactory definition of "ternary category" understood as a collection of objects and ternary morphisms that compose in a particular way, it is far from being unique.</p>

<p>Is there an ELI5 introduction to operadic categories and "pasting schemes"? As an example of what I'm looking for: both the original Joyal paper and the Bergeron et al book on Species is a comfortable read for me. Something like that.</p>

<p>Hello all, <br>
I'm Mohamed Rashad, MSc. Student in Computer Engineering at AAST Cairo, Egypt. <br>
I do category theory for Machine learning mainly for my degree, and I've been studying Applied CT for the past 2 years, </p>
<p>I actually "discovered" category theory in my undergraduate years, when I was studying electronics/comm related topics and software at the same time, and I found by intuition that we can move between electronic/control/signal/comm systems almost easily using some informal ways (you know, engineering hacks and so), and it's accepted in the industry, while also having good models for these systems (I can easily verify the correctness of any electronic circuit for example).. yet I didn't find this in the software world, where everything seemed to be like plumbing to me, and only making things work-ish.. so I started researching how to use control theory in designinig software, while studying abstract algebra on the side.. one thing and the other, I was studying theoretical CS and going through Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondance, that's when I discovered category (and type) theory.. and I explored some articles and stuff.. then it all linked together and It's like I've found my lost child :D </p>
<p>Since then I've been dedicating myself to category theory (and with less attention type theory).. in order to explore this area, and help bring these amazing tools of categorical thinking to the industry.. which is influencing my MSc. work right now.</p>
<p>Anyway, long intro, I'm very happy to be around, also thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> for the invitation <span aria-label="victory" class="emoji emoji-270c" role="img" title="victory">:victory:</span>  hope I can be an addition to the community <span aria-label="smiling face" class="emoji emoji-263a" role="img" title="smiling face">:smiling_face:</span></p>

I proved surjectivity for different variant of higher Chow groups that my supervisor invented. Apparently also these variant could be used for Physics. I am also very interested in Physics as well so in my spare time I study it. Nice to meet everyone! Hopefully we can have great discussion in future.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,  </p>
<p>My name is Guillaume (french for William). I am a M2 student at Université Paris-Cité. Actually, it is my second one. The first one was about theoretical physics (gauge theories and differential geometry). </p>
<p>My interest for Physics lead me to the duality between algebra and geometry. A big part of it is Isbell duality. To take into account any kind of algebra, I have learnt enriched category theory. Until today, I have studied algebraic geometry, a bit of differential geometry and of homotopy theory. I am also interested in what logic can tell us about algebraic and geometric structures, also I have some basis in mathematical logic, but less than any mathematical logic M2 student. </p>
<p>To sum up, nowadays, I am interested in all the applications of enriched category theory (especially Physics and Logic) and all what can give a new viewpoint on this. </p>
<p>Hope to learn great categorical things with you!</p>

Right now I'm learning about databases and state machines, but I get easily distracted <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
<p>I look forward to learning more, see you in the threads!</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I don't think I've introduced myself yet (possibly because I didn't realize there was an introduction channel, but shhh...).<br>
My name is Logan Hyslop, I am an undergraduate at UCLA, currently entering into my second year.  I'm currently just exploring my interests, but I quite enjoyed reading condensed math and now analytic geometry, I like categorifications so I am very excited that Professor Rouquier is teaching a course on higher representation theory this Fall, especially since I took a course on Khovanov homology last Spring which was quite fun.  I am currently also working on learning infinity category theory, through <a href="https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf">Riehl's text</a>, which I really really really enjoy reading (it's an amazing book so far and I will talk about it constantly with whoever will listen).<br>
Some other things about me, pronouns he/him/his, I have ADHD, and enjoy sailing.  I actually set up a <a href="https://loganhyslop.github.io/">webpage</a> recently (though it definitely needs a lot of work before it's actually any decent).<br>
I guess that's my introduction, so <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span>.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I just joined the category theory zulip last week! My name is Jason Parker, and I'm currently starting my third (and final) year as a postdoctoral researcher at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, working with Rory Lucyshyn-Wright. I'm especially interested in enriched algebraic theories and monads and their various applications to mathematics and computer science, and I've recently developed an interest in applied category theory as well (especially applications of category theory to databases). My website is <a href="https://www.jasonparkermath.com/">https://www.jasonparkermath.com/</a>. Before starting this postdoc, I did my PhD at the University of Ottawa on <em>isotropy</em>, a topic that was co-invented by one of my advisors, Pieter Hofstra, who died unexpectedly this past spring. Philip Scott was my PhD advisor as well.  I will write a more detailed post in the "our work" stream sometime this week!</p>

<p>(My website is <a href="https://mstone.info">https://mstone.info</a>. Anyway, in recent months, I've spent some quality time thinking about algorithms for <em>drawing</em> diagrams, particularly a flavor that is commonly used for depicting hierarchical control systems in some corners of the systems engineering world, resulting in a free software package, <a href="https://mstone.info/depict/">https://mstone.info/depict/</a> + <a href="https://github.com/mstone/depict">https://github.com/mstone/depict</a>, which I have recently become re-interested in categorifying / formalizing.)</p>

<p>(Specifically, one aspect of this software that I am interested in studying more carefully is an observation that the drawing process I have discovered, bugs notwithstanding, seems to me to be expressible as a composition of a series of ~4 information-preserving transformations or elaborations that each have the flavor to me of being possible compositions of adjoint functors -- although I am unfortunately still at the very beginning of trying to formally state and then check this intuition.)</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Hugo Bacard. I’ve been hanging around for while but I'm kind of a "e-shy" person. I think it's time to introduce myself :). So far my interests were in homotopy theory, especially in [weakly] enriched category theory. I would like to learn and do a research work in applied category theory and in ML. I live  in the Paris area (in France :D).</p>

<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I learned about CT Zulip thanks to Prof Dmitri Pavlov, who was kind enough to send me a link.<br>
I've been here for some time now but have never introduced myself yet (maybe because I'd never given that a thought until now). So here it comes.</p>
<p>I'm Amartya, an undergraduate student interested in (stable) homotopy theory, higher(model) category theory, higher topos theory, HoTT and categorical logic. I've also recently been interested in Higher Algebra, Higher Operadic stuff and intermediate model structures on simplicial presheaves. I've also been thinking about higher realizability models of HoTT for some time now, which is a work in progress(about which I'll talk a bit at CaCS 2022). Some more details may be found on my <a href="https://amartyasd.github.io/">website</a>, which I set up recently (which needs a lot of work, to be fair).</p>
<p>I look forward to keeping learning stuff here.</p>

<p>Hi All, with the permission of the original authors I'd like to announce a new book on applied category theory.   "A Categorical Defense of Our Future: is the first book about category theory written for business leaders and business owners, CEOs, and executives.<br>
Anyone who deals with large-scale challenges around data, safety, and systems will find this book to be required reading.<br>
The authors Brandon Baylor and Esteban Montero are MIT-educated senior engineers. Between them, they have four master's degrees and nearly thirty years of engineering experience at global companies."     <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/time-radically-approach-challenges-modern-121400881.html">https://www.yahoo.com/now/time-radically-approach-challenges-modern-121400881.html</a></p>

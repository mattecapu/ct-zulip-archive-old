<p>Hello! I'm brand new to this website and still figuring things out. I am a phd student working on philosophy of physics stuff.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Srikanth and I am a Ph.D student from India. I joined as a physics student but I am working with a mathematician now. I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>
<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! I'm a PhD student in aerospace engineering. My research is in stochastic dynamical systems, and I'm trying to create <a href="https://github.com/drewmcneely/girypy">a library</a> to represent control and estimation schemes using Markov categories. I asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276702">@Tobias Fritz</span> for some help, and in our discussions he suggested I check this place out.</p>
<p>There's a lot I want to do with this library, but I'm just starting to expose myself to the work that others have done in monoidal categories. I'm hoping I can utilize some of it!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309295">@Dario Stein</span> This is super interesting! Do you plan on extending to other Markov categories aside from <strong>Gauss</strong>? That's what I'm trying to do currently, but I often get stuck.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm a Postdoc in graph theory and computational complexity who's recently started to transition into applied category theory. </p>
<p>I work on structural graph theory (mostly) and I study so called 'recursive graph decompositions' (i.e. tree-width, clique-width etc etc). Lately my work has started to focus on categorical characterizations and generalizations of these graph-theoretic notions. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool that this community exists, so thanks for having me! I look forward to meeting you all :)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="481356">@Benjamin Merlin Bumpus</span>. There was recently some discussion about if/how category theory might be applied to graph theory <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/enriched.20graphs">here</a>.

<p>Hi! If you don't know the recent paper "Monoidal width" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07582">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07582</a>), that's extremely relevant here</p>

<p>Hi everyone!<br>
My name is Jacob Zelko and I am a researcher at Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control.<br>
I have formal training in biomedical engineering, biomedical informatics, and medical anthropology and currently serve as the PI in an observational health characterization study.</p>
<p>I was exposed almost by chance to Category Theory through working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> and other members of the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
I was greatly smitten by the ideas in CT as I had been thinking for several years about knowledge management and information systems - going so far as to read some old papers pertaining to cybernetics and control theory.<br>
When I stumbled across CT, it just made complete sense and I was sold on the idea as it helped me put in order my thoughts on relating the typically unrelatable.<br>
Currently, my interest in Category Theory lies in determining how to compose research studies in order to create novel research studies - especially in the domain of observational and public health research. </p>
<p>As an aside, I have a vested interest in visualization as I am the co-creator of the <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Julia Animation and Visualization engine, Javis.jl</a>, and am currently exploring methods of creating a tool to create commonly used visualizations in CT research through my <a href="https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/LuxCat.jl/">small side project, LuxCat.jl</a>, while interoperating within the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
Furthermore, I am the author of a small website called <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/C3T">Crash Course Category Theory (C3T for short)</a> that contains my notes as a non-mathematician learning CT.</p>
<p>Pleasure to be here!</p>
<p>P.S.  For fun, here is an animation of an upcoming feature made by a Javis contributor named John and an example of a diagram representing a simple ACSet defined in Julia!</p>

<p>Hello! I'm brand new to this website and still figuring things out. I am a phd student working on philosophy of physics stuff.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Srikanth and I am a Ph.D student from India. I joined as a physics student but I am working with a mathematician now. I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>
<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="452693">@Samuel Steakley</span>, what a pleasant surprise to see you here!!! :)</p>
<p>Hello everyone! I'm a PhD student in aerospace engineering. My research is in stochastic dynamical systems, and I'm trying to create <a href="https://github.com/drewmcneely/girypy">a library</a> to represent control and estimation schemes using Markov categories. I asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276702">@Tobias Fritz</span> for some help, and in our discussions he suggested I check this place out.</p>
<p>There's a lot I want to do with this library, but I'm just starting to expose myself to the work that others have done in monoidal categories. I'm hoping I can utilize some of it!</p>

<p>Hi Drew, I'm also interested in Markov categories and conditioning! Have you checked out my little implementation <a href="https://github.com/damast93/GaussianInfer">here</a>? Feel free to let me know if you have specific things in mind with your library</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309295">@Dario Stein</span> This is super interesting! Do you plan on extending to other Markov categories aside from <strong>Gauss</strong>? That's what I'm trying to do currently, but I often get stuck.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm a Postdoc in graph theory and computational complexity who's recently started to transition into applied category theory. </p>
<p>I work on structural graph theory (mostly) and I study so called 'recursive graph decompositions' (i.e. tree-width, clique-width etc etc). Lately my work has started to focus on categorical characterizations and generalizations of these graph-theoretic notions. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool that this community exists, so thanks for having me! I look forward to meeting you all :)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="481356">@Benjamin Merlin Bumpus</span>. There was recently some discussion about if/how category theory might be applied to graph theory <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/enriched.20graphs">here</a>. I'm sure people would be interested to hear your perspective.</p>

<p>Hi! If you don't know the recent paper "Monoidal width" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07582">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07582</a>), that's extremely relevant here</p>

<p>and, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> ,  thanks for the link;  I saw this on Twitter last week and it seems rather interesting! <br>
Kocsis and I also considered a similar topic (although our methods are very different from Paweł and Elena's) by introducing 'Spined Categories' (which you can find here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01841">https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01841</a>    &lt;---  a new version should hit the arXiv next week)</p>

<p>Hi all! First time on Zulip :) I'm a PhD student in the CDT for Safe and Trusted @ King's &amp; Imperial College London and I'm working with category theory in geometric deep learning - trying to use CT for explainability techniques and finding safe ways of using AI. Generally trying to find out what neural nets are thinking most of the time :) Exciting to be here with the big names!</p>

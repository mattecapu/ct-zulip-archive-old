<p>Hello! I'm brand new to this website and still figuring things out. I am a phd student working on philosophy of physics stuff.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Srikanth and I am a Ph.D student from India. I joined as a physics student but I am working with a mathematician now. I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>
<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! I'm a PhD student in aerospace engineering. My research is in stochastic dynamical systems, and I'm trying to create <a href="https://github.com/drewmcneely/girypy">a library</a> to represent control and estimation schemes using Markov categories. I asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276702">@Tobias Fritz</span> for some help, and in our discussions he suggested I check this place out.</p>
<p>There's a lot I want to do with this library, but I'm just starting to expose myself to the work that others have done in monoidal categories. I'm hoping I can utilize some of it!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309295">@Dario Stein</span> This is super interesting! Do you plan on extending to other Markov categories aside from <strong>Gauss</strong>? That's what I'm trying to do currently, but I often get stuck.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm a Postdoc in graph theory and computational complexity who's recently started to transition into applied category theory. </p>
<p>I work on structural graph theory (mostly) and I study so called 'recursive graph decompositions' (i.e. tree-width, clique-width etc etc). Lately my work has started to focus on categorical characterizations and generalizations of these graph-theoretic notions. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool that this community exists, so thanks for having me! I look forward to meeting you all :)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="481356">@Benjamin Merlin Bumpus</span>. There was recently some discussion about if/how category theory might be applied to graph theory <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/enriched.20graphs">here</a>.

<p>Hi everyone!<br>
My name is Jacob Zelko and I am a researcher at Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control.<br>
I have formal training in biomedical engineering, biomedical informatics, and medical anthropology and currently serve as the PI in an observational health characterization study.</p>
<p>I was exposed almost by chance to Category Theory through working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> and other members of the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
I was greatly smitten by the ideas in CT as I had been thinking for several years about knowledge management and information systems - going so far as to read some old papers pertaining to cybernetics and control theory.<br>
When I stumbled across CT, it just made complete sense and I was sold on the idea as it helped me put in order my thoughts on relating the typically unrelatable.<br>
Currently, my interest in Category Theory lies in determining how to compose research studies in order to create novel research studies - especially in the domain of observational and public health research. </p>
<p>As an aside, I have a vested interest in visualization as I am the co-creator of the <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Julia Animation and Visualization engine, Javis.jl</a>, and am currently exploring methods of creating a tool to create commonly used visualizations in CT research through my <a href="https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/LuxCat.jl/">small side project, LuxCat.jl</a>, while interoperating within the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
Furthermore, I am the author of a small website called <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/C3T">Crash Course Category Theory (C3T for short)</a> that contains my notes as a non-mathematician learning CT.</p>
<p>Pleasure to be here!</p>
<p>P.S.  For fun, here is an animation of an upcoming feature made by a Javis contributor named John and an example of a diagram representing a simple ACSet defined in Julia!</p>

<p>Hi I'm Miguel, or rather MA, for short. My life started high in energy (Math. Physics) and I've been gradually radiating off on my way through Stat Mech, Biology and now working in IT. I never found the right/enough time to learn beyond the basics of CT and I'm hoping being here around reading and possibly asking questions may help me get beyond that 101 level. So thanks for having this running and being welcoming.</p>

<p>Hello!   Right now you can watch a bunch of us talking about chemistry and category theory at <a class="stream" data-stream-id="322714" href="/#narrow/stream/322714-practice.3A-chemistry">#practice: chemistry</a>.   We're just getting started; we'll be meeting at the end of May to work on this.</p>
<p>There's a lot of other stuff going on here, too.   I guess you need to subscribe to streams to see what's going on in those streams.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> . It looks like I'm subscribed to everything, so I'd just have to check them out.</p>

<p>John Baez sent me an invite, and here I am.  In my retirement from the military-industrial-intelligence complex, I am looking into understanding the universe as it really is and not as one would like it to be.  Discovered The Laws of Form while reviewing Stan Tenen's book "The Alphabet that Changed the World."  Discovered Burkhard Heim's Extended Quantum Field Theory, and then his Theory of Everything, and realized that the Laws of Form provided the axioms for Heim's Theory.  It has been a wild ride since then.  Just came to the understanding that, as George Spencer-Brown wrote, if something is obvious from experience, but very hard to prove, then it is probably very close to an axiom of the real world.  Turns out the Jordan Curve Theorem is hard to prove because it is a statement of the definition of a distinction in the Laws of Form.  This turns topology on its head, and means that the world is quantized by area.</p>

<p>I wrote a paper with Tom Leinster and Tobias Fritz called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1791">A characterization of entropy in terms of information loss</a>, and later one with Tobias Fritz called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3067">A Bayesian characterization of relative entropy.</a>.  The first provided a category-theoretic characterization of entropy, while the second provided such a characterization for relative entropy.</p>

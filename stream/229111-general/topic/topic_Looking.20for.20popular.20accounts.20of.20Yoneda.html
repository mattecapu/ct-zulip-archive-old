<p>Hi everyone, I'm looking for "popular science" articles (or something similar) that talk about the Yoneda embedding. I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>
<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this up! Earlier today I remembered having read this article (and finding it great), but when I went to look it up I was sort of disappointed that it was more mathematically oriented than I remembered. But now I see that I discarded it too quickly:  that passage you quoted is really good! I am writing something along the lines of what I wanted (in Spanish) and I think it might be a good idea to translate/paraphrase Tai-Danae there</p>

<p>Still, I find it surprising that there doesn't seem to be any text online aimed at e.g. Philosophy students, trying to relate the "Yoneda perspective" to ideas about things being determined by their relationships to other things, or debates about the existence of intrinsic properties, or essences. Things that people have been talking about for millennia</p>

<p>By "aimed at Philosophy students" I don't mean to say a text that engages with specifically philosophical problems, that would be too technical as well... I mean more like "here, I translate part of what makes this cool to me into a language that philosophically minded people can enjoy and find interesting" (without necessarily engaging with the problems that could arise from trying to do so rigorously)</p>

<p>When talking about the Yoneda perspective outside of mathematical contexts/to non-mathematicians, I think one important point to emphasize is that the lemma works when we can expect to know everything about the thing we are studying, when there is no “hidden information” that we might care about.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable assumption in mathematics (in fact, it’s sort of the point of mathematics IMO), but less often in the real world. For instance, you probably would say that humans could not be fully characterized by their observable properties – no matter how detailed, comprehensive, or hypothetical your collection of properties/relationships for a human is. Humans _probably_ have some hidden state that’s never going to be externally visible (or is random, etc.).</p>
<p>But this is just a small caveat, since the Yoneda perspective can be very useful when talking about observable parts of the real world and you just have to restrict your attention to that to be strictly in the spirit of the maths. (And perhaps this is just saying that isomorphism and equality of objects are different relations.) I just like to bring it up when talking about the philosophy of math.</p>

<p>Avoiding a debate on reductionism, I'd like to point out that the Yoneda lemma depends on the identity morphism. We're not just talking about "externally visible" states/properties: it also includes any "internal" states <em>which are included in the category</em>. The "everything" in question is "everything that has been abstracted into the categorical model", and Yoneda really does talk about that everything. The question of whether we can successfully model an informal 'everything' in a sufficiently rich categorical model is independent of the Yoneda perspective, but I suppose "be aware of which details are captured in your model/the assumptions your model depends on" is always a healthy thing to keep in mind.</p>

<p>I can't quite help with a 'pop' account, but I can point to a philosophical account. <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WALCHA-2">Patrick Walsh writes</a>  about the justification of path induction in homotopy type theory, in response to a <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LADIIH">pair</a> of <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LADIIH-3">papers</a> by Ladyman &amp; Presnell; Walsh ties an account of Yoneda to the view of <em>inferentialism</em>, which is roughly the view that the meaning of expressions is given by how they are used (in inferences, assertions, and so on), and draws lessons about the admissibility of "tonk"-like logical connectives.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is the better setting for what I said, sorry. If all of your properties are external (e.g. behavioral facts about particular beings in some system), implying that you don't have haecceities, then you don't have a setting to talk about internal properties of them, like identity of beings outside of their behavior. This is not surprising if you make this precise in a formal framework, but I think it's worth pointing out to non-mathematicians. Since I think if you phrase things like the Yoneda principle or identity of indiscernibles non-mathematically, the first intuition is skepticism, “why does a bunch of relationships/properties determine all you need to know about a thing?” (if your intuition for “thing” is not “mathematical object”). And then I get curious about what that says about the world mathematics versus the real world. Anyways, IANAPhilosopher.</p>

I don't know if Rovelli also applies category theory in RQM? I don't recall it mentioned in the book, even though the link to Yoneda seems obvious, at least on a superficial level...</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>No observation is possible without an observer. Hence there is no Hilbert space associated with a closed universe. Any observer is part of a universe, hence occupies a 3-manifold with boundary, and makes observations on another such with a shared boundary.</li>

<li>There is no observation at a distance. Thus the Hilbert spaces in the theory reflect the interface between observer and system. This means they are associated to surfaces.</li>

<p>""tonk"-like"?</p>

<p>'Tonk' is the name of a logical connective meant to challenge naive notions of proof-theoretic semantics. It's described by its inference rules in a natural deduction system: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math

(By "tonk-like," I just meant putative connectives like this.) The lesson we draw is: it's not just the existence of any old inference rules that gives meaningful logical connectives, they have to be the right sort of inference rules. They have to be appropriately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_harmony">"harmonious"</a> with the rest of the inference rules (perhaps part of some 'interlocking adjoints' as Lawvere might put it).</p>

<p>Thanks!  So "tonk-like rules" is a philosopher's idea, a bit like "grue", designed to test our understanding?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278867">@Gabriel Goren Roig</span>,</p>
<p>this is not what you asked for, but I think it's worth mentioning anyway - apologies for the shameless plug, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I spent decades wondering what made some people feel that the Yoneda Lemma and the Yoneda Embedding were "simple" in some sense. It turned out that what I was lacking was a way to draw the Lemma - and the Embedding - in a certain shape that made both the main bijections and the gory details all visible at the same time. That shape is explained in the sections 7.3, 8.4 and 8.5 of this paper,</p>

<p>Here's an attempt to put Emily Riehl's example from the ACT2020 in my shape:</p>

<p>And here's the idea of "universal element" in that shape:<br>

<p>Not sure this relevant to your question, but, in type theory, the Yoneda embedding/lemma is (somewhat exactly) functional extensionality of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Pi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord">Π</span></span></span></span>-types.</p>

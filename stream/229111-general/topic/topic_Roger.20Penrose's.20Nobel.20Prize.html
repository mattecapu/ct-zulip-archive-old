<p>I tried to explain what Penrose did to win the Nobel:</p>

<p>I had some discussion with someone, and it was also pointed out at Peter Woit's blog, that in all likelihood, Hawking wouldn't have gotten the prize since the singularity theorem <em>for black holes</em> is really just Penrose's. The version of the theorem that deals with an initial singularity ("inevitability of the big bang", as it were) really covers a different physical phenomenon. Someone else I was talking to who worked with Penrose at Oxford reckons Hawking had "made enemies" and so there was opposition to him getting such an awardâ€”I don't really know about that, but it highlights how ... human the whole process is.</p>

<p>Hmm, it's true Hawking's singularity theorem didn't apply to black holes.  He was one of the best physicists whose work was done after 1960, but oh well - there's more to life than Nobel prizes, and he got plenty of respect!</p>

<p>He was on Star Trek.</p>

<p>Way better than a Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Yeah I have no doubts about the <em>power</em> of ML, it's more that AI research is (or at least should be) a lot more than its implementation in ML. Take <a href="https://medium.com/@deepmindsafetyresearch/what-mechanisms-drive-agent-behaviour-e7b8d9aee88">this article</a>, for example. While the GridWorld implementations are cute, taking an experimental approach seems hugely inefficient when thought experiments would have been enough to identify the pitfalls.</p>

<p>They are not synonymous but if you stand far enough they are too close to be distinguishable. As you approach them you quickly realize they're separate. So I think it's a function of who is using the term, and where they stand.</p>

<p>Just my 2cents: You may consider topological data analysis to be part of AI as well. It's not directly AI, but very closely related: In practice, you cannot feed raw data to ML algorithms, you need to clean the data up and it is a very time consuming effort. So data analysis/extraction techniques that allow to perform these operations automatically are of great interest for AI researchers.</p>

<p>maybe I can  join in to say that in my opinion "Alignment and safety problems in AI " do need work to IMPROVE their datasets completely. they are unfair, biased, racist, sexist, privacy-invading, status-quo reinforcing. this (like climate change) is not a problem for the future, it's a problem now! it's sending black and brown people to prison for crimes they didn't commit, it's not allowing people to open accounts, get mortgages, get jobs. Not a philosophical problem, but a problem at the interface of tech and social policy/social sciences. my two cents.</p>

<p>I resent the implication that "philosophical" means 'esoteric' here, that's certainly not what it means to me. These are problems of ethics (which falls under philosophy!), and precise, applicable answers to these questions will make the difference that you're looking for. The fact that you're so unimpressed with the practice of philosophy that you dismiss it out of hand speaks to the sore need for such work to be done.</p>

<p>In any case, the very same fact that ML is reaching such important results by essentially heuristic means is philosophically interesting. Indeed, the idea of science as a completely formal thing is quite recent: We used to build entire cathedrals, pyramids and tons of other amazing stuff purely heuristically. Architects back then had no clue about what a tensor of inertia was, and still... This is to say that I am not necessarily a fan of the motto "ML people have no clue about why their stuff works." I think they have, it's just that their intuition does not respect what we people in hard sciences usually mean when we say that we know something.</p>

<p>I was giving for granted that you wanted to work in AI on the mathematical side of things tho, are you referring to <em>pure</em> philosophy instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People brought maths into philosophy through the practice of logic; I expect to be leveraging my mathematical background in the process, but ultimately yes, I want to do what for now is considered "pure" philosophy. Hopefully also making it formal so that other mathematicians and computer scientists can attack it alongside me.</p>

<p>I was getting career advice on their Discord server today, as it happens! They gave me the impression that if I want to work in Europe (UK excluded) then my best bet is to apply for funding to do independent research. I have some concerns that that's a risky career move for a young researcher, so I'm still looking for more structured alternatives, but I may eventually do that.</p>

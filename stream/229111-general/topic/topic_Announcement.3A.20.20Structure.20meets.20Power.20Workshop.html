<p>Hi All,<br>
We're organising a little workshop (affiliated with LICS 2021) with the purpose of bridging the division between the semantically oriented ("Structure") and algorithmically oriented ("Power") branches of theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>Dates: 27-28 June 2021<br>
Workshop website: <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/conference/structure-meets-power-2021">https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/conference/structure-meets-power-2021</a></p>
<p>The workshop stems from the joint project of Samson Abramsky and Anuj Dawar (called "Resources and co-Resources") where we use  comonads and other tools from category theory in finite model theory.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in the broader topic of the workshop is welcome to participate/attend!</p>

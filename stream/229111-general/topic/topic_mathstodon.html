<p>Hi I have an account on Mathstodon. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@bblfish">https://mathstodon.xyz/@bblfish</a><br>
Do you?</p>

<p>Mathstodon does seem to be a bit slow today. It even was down a few minutes earlier.</p>

<p>More users are being driven by the news about Twitter losing more employees (also some weird news about them being locked out of buildings).<br>

<p>I hope it's not the Ruby code Mastodon is written in that is causing the problems. Twitter had uptime problems at the beginning too when they were written in Ruby, then moved to Scala.</p>

<p>I don't think Ruby will be much of a problem at mathstodon's size. It's more of a problem for the larger instances.</p>

<p>Do you know what it takes to run a Mastodon instance? How easy is it to create a new instance? Do you have a server at home, or rent a server on a cloud? How much responsibility does it take? What is the burden on those running it?</p>

<p>It's Christian Lawson-Perfect who runs mathstodon. He wrote a blog post about it here: <a href="https://checkmyworking.com/posts/2022/11/mastodon-admin-experiences/">https://checkmyworking.com/posts/2022/11/mastodon-admin-experiences/</a></p>

<p>Thanks, this looks like a good starting point ... I joined Mastodon recently but I dont find much interesting discussion there ... so I am wondering whether it could be worth creating my own instance and gathering like-minded people.</p>

<p>At this point you have to find the people you already know - perhaps they write their mastodon ID on twitter or in this channel, or somewhere else. Then you look at their follows and followers list, and search for people you already know, and follow those. So you build your social network. Of course here you just follow John Baez, and he knows everyone already important in Category Theory (I guess at least) <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez">https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez</a> . If you want to find political science scholars, I just found this  <a href="https://scholar.social/@SamCrawley/109366587884501943">https://scholar.social/@SamCrawley/109366587884501943</a> where he links to a huge list of scholars in that field. Sound interesting and dangerous to click on those.</p>
<p>Being on Mathstodon there is already more  Math discussion than what I could follow in a lifetime.  But I have also found a lot of people on other servers that I follow. The nice thing is I can look at the discussion on mathstodon and that in my personal list and compare the quality.  </p>
<p>If you follow me you'll find my list is related to programming decentralised social networks, so I follow category theory, scala especially cats libs, open source in general, w3c and ietf standards, security, knowledge engineers, philosophers... It is very likely much too eclectic to build a big following.</p>

<p>I actually started worked on the w3c activity pub standards behind Mastodon when they started, but I did not say around long, as I was more interested in the project that Tim Berners-Lee calls Solid which should go even further in helping create any number of decentralised apps. </p>
<p>Then I got lost in CT for 4 years or so. I was looking around to see how modal logic fit into category theory to see if it could help me understand security.  The first really intersting thing I found that amazed me was when I read this article "Modal Logics are Coalgebraic" on which I think you are a co-author <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276830">@Alexander Kurz</span> :-)  So I asked Corina Cirstea to be my supervisor as I was at Southampton.  But I ran out of money and have been building Solid tools in the last few year sponsored by the EU.<br>

<p>John Baez has this thread where he lists some of his friends with Mastodon accounts: <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109262546588286591">https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109262546588286591</a>. That's probably a good place to start.</p>

<p>But with the arrival of the people I listed, things are getting better.  In particular Martin Escardo:</p>
<p><a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@MartinEscardo">https://mathstodon.xyz/@MartinEscardo</a></p>
<p>is regularly writing nice multi-part posts on constructive mathematics, type theory etc.   I wish some of you folks who know more about these things that I do would reply to his posts!</p>

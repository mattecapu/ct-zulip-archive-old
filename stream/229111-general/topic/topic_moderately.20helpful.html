<p>I've not yet been nearly proactive enough yet to help the server -- we have a nice stream structure laid out waiting to be implemented, and there are guidelines we've recognized as necessary that we haven't yet made clear to the community. I apologize for being slow with this stuff. Part of the issue is being <em>overwhelmed</em> -- I think many members may have have shied away from the server because there is such a flood of messages. Online communication comes easier to some than others, and we need to respect this.</p>

<p>I've been quite active on this server; is there anything I can do to get more involved in eg moderation? I've been organising conversations by branching topics wherever I see the focus has shifted, but if there's more I can do, even if it's just on a few streams, I would love to help.</p>

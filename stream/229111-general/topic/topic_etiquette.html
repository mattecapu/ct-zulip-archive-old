<p>Regrettably I haven't been the greatest participant here, but my years of being a moderator hopefully give me a way of dealing with some of my karma by sharing some experiences. </p>
<ul>
<li>Self-policing - OK, I got this one</li>
<li>Egoless interaction - the Big one</li>
<li>Low drama - my failure, I claimed I was departing twice, and yet. Just can't put that CT down.</li>
<li>No mind reading - communicate about needed information</li>
<li>Come with something to give</li>
<li>Build a nice community and you will have a nice place in cyberspace to hang your hat.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the list, and it would be nice to build an acrostic which gets the same points across. There's an acrostic endorsed by the National Autistic Society, <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/about/strategies/spell.aspx" title="https://www.autism.org.uk/about/strategies/spell.aspx">SPELL</a>, which gives a general framework for creating a supportive environment for people on the spectrum. If any of you know anyone on the spectrum -- family members, students, friends -- this can be an incredibly helpful set of principles to bear in mind. </p>
<p>Structure [consistency, safe and predictable environments] <br>
Positive [approaches and expectations]<br>
Empathy<br>
Low arousal<br>
Links [to patients, professionals, families, advocates]</p>

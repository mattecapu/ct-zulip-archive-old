<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276695">Posina Venkata Rayudu</span> what is "Unity-respecting Change"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you Morgan! Unity-respecting change is structure-respecting morphism.  As you know, all mathematical transformations, beginning with functions between between sets, are structure-preserving.  Of course, in the case of sets, there is almost-zero cohesion, i.e., discrete, which is preserved as a function maps a domain element to a codomain element.  The seemingly tall claim {"all mathematical") is justified by the omnipresent 'do not tear' (please see Lawvere &amp; Schanuel, Conceptual Mathematics, p.210).  The Yoneda lemma showing that structure-respecting morphisms are natural (ibid, pp. 149-150, 378) is reason enough to baptize category theory as the theory of naturality.  It is this naturality that makes the effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences reasonable (cf. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0kLC-pridI">we are given changes/contrasts, which we objectify, which, in turn, moves as one thing</a>).  All of this is but a prologue: more than the mathematics, it is the everyday life that screams NATURAL: as I walk to Malabar Cafe for coffee, the motion (or, more broadly, the changes) that takes me to the cafe preserves the unity that is poison.  So, is the case with the growth and development of plants and animals.  Obviously, there's an unavoidable question: what if a change chops me into pieces; no worries: i/we go from one category to another (and there is no escaping the unity-respecting change, albeit the specific unity (cf. discrete, codiscrete, etc.) may be different, which, nevertheless, is respected.  Admittedly, after all said nothing new has been said, or so it seems to me (except for my juvenile twinkle at taking a shot at Newton ;)  Please let me know if I answered your question or went off on a tangent (as is my wont ;)  Equally importantly, please correct me of any mistakes in my understanding.  Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276695">@Posina Venkata Rayudu</span> thank you for this fundamental topic!  I am interested to think more about structure preserving transformations.  One source of ideas is architect Christopher Alexander, his four volume "The Nature of Order", and his 15 properties of life (especially: strong centers, clear boundaries, levels of scale), which he relates to wholeness preserving transformations. Have you thought about his ideas?</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="589612">@Andrius Kulikauskas</span> for your encouring note.  I must admit that I am (embarrasingly) unaware of Christopher Alexander and his "The Nature of Order", leave alone his 15 properties of life.  But, I got interested in architecture, upon reading my guru Professor F. William Lawvere briefly mention it in <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/27/tr27.pdf">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/27/tr27.pdf</a> (in this context it may be noted that mathematical objects are not structures, but can be represented/modeled as structures/diagrams in a structureless background, also according to Professor F. William Lawvere).  As much as I consciously and effortfuly try to avoid studying anything other than Professor F. William Lawvere, your "wholeness preserving transformations" is definitely on the top of my list-to-understand, especially given that one may define SUM (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2) as a whole that is completely determined by its parts (which is the closest I got to a verbal rendition of the universal mapping property definition of SUM; i forgot if the phrasing was intended to remind one of the Gestalt maxim: a whole is different from the sum of its parts ;)  Be that as it may, would you be kind enough to suggest a source (book/papers) to begin my study of the work of Christopher Alexander (pardon me, for I'm not a big fan of googling ;)  Thanking you, yours truly, posina</p>

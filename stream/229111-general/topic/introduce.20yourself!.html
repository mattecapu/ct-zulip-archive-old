<p>Hello! I'm brand new to this website and still figuring things out. I am a phd student working on philosophy of physics stuff.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Srikanth and I am a Ph.D student from India. I joined as a physics student but I am working with a mathematician now. I picked up most of the maths in the last two years.. My primary interests are quantum field theories. I am presently interested in Dijkgraff Witten theory and its applications to representation theory. </p>
<p>It's great to see so many prolific math expositors at a single place. I wish to learn a lot from this place and try to contribute  whenever I can.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

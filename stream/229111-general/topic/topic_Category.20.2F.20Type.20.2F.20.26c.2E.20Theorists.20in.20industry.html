<p>(Please feel free to move this, I’m not entirely sure where the best place to put it is)</p>
<p>Hey all, who here is not in academia, and what do you do?! I have worked in the formal methods space in the past, though, for the last 18 months or so have been doing something else entirely (happy to say more if anyone is interested). I’m curious what companies are out there in the FM space and what they’re up to.</p>

<p>there's us at Conexus AI, we formalize databases and similar things using category theory and use formal methods from term rewriting, functional programming, etc, to implement ETL/data integration in provably correct and optimal ways</p>

<p>Tough to beat <a href="https://galois.com/">Galois</a> and/or <a href="https://www.sri.com/cyber-formal-methods/">SRI</a> in industrial research on FM, though of course some of the largest information tech and aero/defense shops also do top-notch FM work. </p>
<p>My shop does some FM work (but I haven't done any here). DM me if interested.</p>
<p>Re: category theory, if I demonstrate a winning value proposition for large cardinals or Langlands or conformal field theory--or category theory--for something that my shop wants me to work on, then that's that. I have accrued a fairly large bag of hammers over the years and despite being an absolute (and relative) dilettante at CT I have been able to fruitfully use it in a few ways, not always indirectly.</p>

<p>Very cool, this is exactly the type of thing I was looking for. I'm wondering who is trying to productize ideas from formal methods and whether or not they're having any luck.</p>

<p>I am in Portland, and know Galois well! I Interviewed for a job there ~5 years ago, but ended up staying where I was at at the time (<a href="https://auxon.io">auxon.io</a> (where I was last involved in the FM space)). As I think about returning because I miss the intellectual itch it scratches, I find myself interested in not just the theory, but the exposition it takes to turn the theory into a product.</p>

<p>That's what me, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277670">@Philipp Zahn</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span>,  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281862">@Daniele Palombi</span>  do. Zero investors, started literally as 'some guys bored with academia', we have a very small amount of grant money coming in, and we are totally revenue positive thanks to good old paying customers.</p>

<p>So if you want an example of a business model that is 'entirely relying on category theory to function' and 'entirely relying on paying customer money to survive', then we check these boxes.</p>

<p>(and yes, I am <strong>incredibly</strong> proud of this! You can actually sell category theory to people!)</p>

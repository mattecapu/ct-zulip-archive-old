<p>hello, I'm Christian. I'm studying with John Baez and the team at UC Riverside. I love category theory, and lots of things. currently I'm working for a distributed computing platform called RChain - it's based on a concurrent language, and we're using categories to give it a good type system.</p>

Most of the time, I’ve been doing activist projects where I could apply programming skills. Actually, last week I'm doing a bot for collecting user data on COVID19 pandemic in Russia. I also have some data analysis experience and now I'm learning TDA. I think that cool visualization can bring together different specialists to work on a common problem, as we see now with pandemic. TDA is also very interesting because it can help avoid research bias. There are interesting articles by Peter Bubenik, Nina Otter and other authors who use categories to develop the theory of persistent homology. But I also very interested in hardware/compilers, so the article mentioned by the <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275923">@jpt4</span> intrigues me.</p>

In the past, I've done a PhD in computational neuroscience, and worked as an IT consultant. I've loved category theory from afar since my undergraduate days, and tried to get a grounding in it whenever I've had a spare moment. I'm really excited about the ACT movement!

<p>Yoo, I'm Stelios, currently a CS PhD student in Belgium. Before that I was doing some shady computer security stuff. Right now I'm working on extending "mathematical operational semantics", a certain category-theoretic representation of PL. I find it amusing that this kind of work is foundational in PL theory yet applied in CT :P.</p>

Lately I've been doing a lot of work on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/" target="_blank" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">categories with open networks as morphisms</a> with Brendan Fong, Daniel Cicala, Kenny Courser, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and Jade Master.  I've also been working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span> on categories in computer science.</p>
<p>I think it's really great that we're starting this.  Starting on Wednesday April 1st our group, <strong>ACT@UCR</strong>, will begin a series of online seminars  at 10am Pacific time = 1pm East Coast time = 5pm (UTC+0).   We hope all of you attend!  We hope to have discussions afterward here!  </p>
<p>I hope that the MIT category theory seminar follows suit.</p>

<p>I've not much time to give a reply tonight. I don't think Noncommutative Topos is an aporia and there was an attempt to define it last year. For Kristeva and the semiotic, in reply to @janet singer, one needs a womans body='place' or topos, which is minor in Deleuzes sense and radical or noncommutative, and whose internal logic is the feminine mysticism=Brouwerism. Another use might be in Topos Quantum Theory which is too bound to Kochen-Specker and the classical observation states. One might want something with stronger entanglement, using tensor products on Quantales. I'd like to have a Many World variant of (non)commutative Topos Quantum Theory. I'm not sure if you are doubtful of the use of a putative noncommutative Topos or you think its proper development could be valid only being more subtle than what I have in mind?</p>

<p>Hi! I've been a software developer for several decades (a bit of everything), but my education was in EE (signal processing).<br>
I still do electronics as a hobby, and amateur radio (WA2HEE).</p>
<p>I'm slowly working through Seven Sketches with a study group at work.<br>
As I currently work at a data science company, I'm interested in functorial data migration, and the math behind linked data (RDF and such).<br>
I thought Lisp had prepared me for functional programming, but Haskell showed me I have a lot to learn about CS math, not just CT.</p>
<p>As a learning exercise I'm trying to model software-defined radio flowgraphs.  There's monoidal categories in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I’m a software developer with JPL; I work on multi-mission ground software at my day job, but in my spare time I like to study algebra, category theory, and logic programming languages. I’m particularly interested recently in applying the categorical mindset to reasoning about software architecture, as opposed to types or algorithms.</p>
<p>Right now I’m just working through Aluffi’s Algebra to warm up with a more familiar (undergraduate!) setting 😅</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Ben! I'm an undergraduate student in computer science with a very strong interest in Programming Language Theory and Category Theory. My current interest is in using CT to help in the software design process. Most papers I've found so far are above my level, so I'm going to catch up on a lot of reading once I'm finished with this last semester of school. I'm planning to start with Seven Sketches, if anyone would like to join me.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm François-René "Faré" Rideau, @ngnghm on twitter for computing stuff. I made trivial use of Category Theory in my unpublished PhD thesis to unify various computational paradigms and formalize the notion of Implementation of one with the other as (opposite of) profunctors, with natural transformations being opposites of code instrumentation / ornaments. At work, I am using both Game Theory and Game Semantics to model and implement applications that use blockchain smart contracts to keep the interests of participants aligned. And I'm hoping to also use Category Theory there. Yet I'm still a beginner who still doesn't fully grok the Yoneda Lemma.</p>

<p>My implementations are actually spans of a full embedding and a regular functor, plus many optional diagrammatic properties. I suppose I could relax the "full embedding" part to fit existing theories, but am not sure how to deal with the extra complexity then.</p>

<p>More questions: can we have a better more uniform notation for category theory and type theory, etc., where function types are covariant with function calls, so either prefix f(x) and a ← b, or postfix call x f and a → b but please no f(x) and a → b. And please no horrible mix of a→b bᵃ [a,b] a⇒b C[a,b] Mor(a,b) Hom(a,b) and more.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I'm Scott Morrison, a mathematician interested in "low dimensional category theory", particularly with connections to topological phases of matter and quantum topology. I love 2- and 3- and even higher categories, but I mostly think about them from a very geometric point of view. If pressed, I will try to argue that (my corner of) higher category theory is more about manifolds, stratifications, cell-complexes, and geometric structures than it is about algebra or homotopy theory.</p>
<p>Mostly I work in the "fusion categories" or "quantum symmetries" community, where a lot of my work has consisted of connecting the sorts of categories which appear to describe topological phases in condensed matter physics with computational and classification problems.</p>
<p>I'm also one of the active contributors to the category theory library in Lean. mathlib (the mathematics library for Lean) is pretty amazing, growing faster, and rapidly approaching being useful. I'd be very happy to talk to people about this side of things, as well.</p>

<p>I am an undergrad mathematics student from Bonn working on type theory and formalization of mathematics in Lean. I have some experience with Haskell, Agda and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275991">@Bartosz Milewski</span>s blog posts. If lectures get postponed further, I would be interested in forming a study group on Homotopy type theory and/or An Invitation to Applied Category Theory (whose authors are in this channel :)).</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Fab. I lead research at a company called Statebox where we apply CT to pretty much everything one can think of. Before that I did my PhD at Oxford with Bob Coecke about categorical quantum mechanics applied to language. Categorical Quantum Mechanics is very cool, while CQM applied to language is now the thing I hate the most in the whole ACT spectrum.</p>

<p>Hello everyone and thanks to Jules and Christian for setting up this group!<br>
I am a PhD student at the University of Birmingham (UK) with Noam Zeilberger and Paul Levy.  My main areas of research are (linear) logic, (monoidal) category theory  and their applications to (quantum) computer science. For my PhD, I am working on (bi)fibrations of polycategories and their relation to star-autonomous structures. Right now, I am working on a polycategorical Grothendieck construction that involves (the polycategory of) multivariable adjunctions.<br>
In a former life, I was a software engineer using formal methods for developing safety-critical embedded software.</p>

<p>Hello. I'm a PhD student at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I work mostly on mathematical aspects of field theories (specially those involving (higher) categorical language and obstruction theory) and categorification. In my country category theory is not popular. Thus, I have no much people to talk and discuss. I helped to create a research group in my university, but we are always finding for some space (actually we have to fight even for very basic things). Thus, it is amazing for me to have this kind of contact! Thank you for this space. Really, thank you!!</p>

<p>Hi, this is Serdar Erbatur. My background is on unification theory, which is a subfield of automated reasoning and has connections to logic, algebra, category theory and TCS in general. I have also done a lot of research in PL (type-based program analysis) when I was postdoc in Germany (with Martin Hofmann between 2014 and 2018). I finished my PhD in 2012 and my advisor was Paliath Narendran. I had the privilage of collaborating with great people such Deepak Kapur, Jose Meseguer, Cathy Meadows, Christophe Ringeissen and many others. Currently, I am a teaching faculty at UT Dallas and continue my reseach. Before Dallas, I was a postdoc in three countries: one year in Italy, 3 years in Germany and approx one year in Spain. My research topics are quite theoretical, though I haven't applied anything from category theory myself. I know that a few category theoretic treatments were developed for unification in the past. I would be glad to talk about possible collaboration with anyone who have interest in my topics.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I'm Ben MacAdam, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary. I mostly work on tangent categories, and I'm particularly interested in how classical geometric structures such as Lie algebroids or linear connections can reappear as enriched Lawvere theories or enriched limit theories. I'm also interested in categorical axiomatizations of differential programming languages (which is where all of my actual publications have been so far).</p>

<p>Regarding tangent categorie: as far as I know, these are categories where each object is equipped with structure similar to the tangent bundle of a manifold.

<p>Hi! I'm Sandro, a data-scientist from Italy with background in physics.<br>
I fell in love with category theory when I read the Rosetta stone article of John.<br>
Then I liked a lot the book of Milewsky and the one of Awodey.</p>
<p>My interest in category theory is twofold:<br>
1 - a practical way to better organize my thoughts and my code when approaching the design of a program; also my work as a data-scientist implies to prove things as faster as you can sometimes (for business reasons): the better you are organized, the better and faster will be the results; and about the quality and repeatability of results, the functional programming point of view is very useful; I totally love the constructive mathematics potential<br>
2 - having a unifying view over mathematics; I have the sensation that since I start understanding a bit of category theory, mathematics seems to me more as a unique thing, instead of a multiverse of different structures which sometimes happen to have connections ; this gave me also a different perspective over theoretical physics</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Simon Pepin Lehalleur. I am a postdoc in Nijmegen (Netherlands). I am interested in algebraic and arithmetic geometry, mostly through the angle of the many facets of the cohomology of algebraic varieties. My research focus is in the theory of motives and motivic homotopy theory. As such, I am mostly an end user of (higher) category theory, but I am always happy to learn more, and I am fascinated by the explosion of applied category theory.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I'm Andrew Hirsch, a postdoc in Saarbrücken, Germany at MPI for Software Systems. My research focuses on giving a good foundation to security reasoning and enforcement. I've used CT theory largely to give semantics to effectful programs, but the more my research butts up against type theory, the more I find myself using it.</p>

<p>CQM applied to language is now the thing I hate the most in the whole ACT spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?! Them's fighting words lol.</p>
<p>CQM applied to language is one of the most amazing things I've seen coming out of ACT. It's not perfect, and people should try applying it to LOTE (languages other than English), but it's got potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My PhD thesis was on the application of CQM to Middle Egyptian (Hyeroglyphs). I don't agree with what you say, but maybe it's better to talk about this in private if you want to know more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lol. Ok, I take all of that back. I had a quick look at the problems you've pointed out in the application to Middle Egyptian, and I think they're quite interesting. CQM (or DisCoCat) is probably not the be-all and end-all of applying CT to linguistics. Sometimes studying the obstructions can be useful too! </p>
<p>Since your thesis, there's been a lot of development in NLP. For example, Baidu's ERNIE (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614996/ai-baidu-ernie-google-bert-natural-language-glue/" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614996/ai-baidu-ernie-google-bert-natural-language-glue/">popular review at TR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE" title="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE">Github repo</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1">arXiv preprint</a>) seems to show that insights gained in studying a LOTE can be applied to the processing of English as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt things can be improved, the main problems I saw are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I worked on this there was zero emphasis on learning. Some people are working to fix that but I think learning should be central, way more than it is now.</li>
<li>The functor from pregroups to whatever semantics doesn't really exist. The "fix" is to use the free CCC generated on a dictionary, but that defeats the purpose of the functor in the first place, at least conceptually. This is a huge problem but not enough people pay attention to it. It is also related to the above point: The functor should be backward, cos grammar should be learned, not imposed.</li>
<li>No one seems to have a real clue of what the "sentence space" is.</li>
<li>Other problems are nastier in nature, but the conceptually biggest ones for me are the three above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Chaitanya LS. I'm a PhD student in Paris, France, working on homotopy type theory and higher algebra. One of the things I'm currently interested in: It is possible to see type theories as "dependently sorted" Lawvere theories (aka contextual categories), and I'm trying to see if one can extract a good notion of "dependently coloured" operad from this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Seems encouraging. </li>
<li>Indeed, the first paper, where instead of the functor you were using products, was much better imho. I am in a similar situation now with cryptography: A functor gives me too much relatedness, and doesn't work. A product gives me too little relatedness, and doesn't work. I think there are slick cartegorical ways to really depict what's going on there, but in the end what you wanna do is just drawing wires between things, and that's easier to implement than to formalize mathematically (!!!).</li>
<li>Yes, I remember you telling me about this. This helps a big deal, no question about this. But the idea of a sentence space is still around, albeit its inpact is reduced. For instance, when you axiomatize the verb "shoots" you do so by applying some features to the object and the subject of the action. This is a very neat thing to do (albeit I can imagine it doesn't work in some circumstances), but it may be still difficult, in practice, to say what does it mean to "apply" such features. In any case I'll wait to see what happens!</li>

<p>Hi all, I'm a (final year) CS PhD student at Northeastern University working on programming language semantics heavily influenced by category theoretic approaches. On the application side my focus is on "gradual typing", interoperability between languages and low-level/intermediate languages, and on the category theory side my interests include categorical logic generally, and more specifically (virtual) double categories, generalized multicategories and gluing approaches to formalizing logical relations</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Daniel, a software engineer with an interest in CT, dynamics and combinatorics. I'm a big fan of Flajolet's work in analytic combinatorics. I am also the author of <a href="http://tetration.org" title="http://tetration.org">http://tetration.org</a>. I consider Stephen Wolfram a valued mentor and am working on upgrading my iterated function and hyperoperator Mathematica software for Wolfram Functions. </p>
<p>Question: Can an iteration functor map a category into the next higher category? Then I may be able to use what I've learned from studying the hyperoperators as a sequence of higher iterated functions to provide some insight into higher categories.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm an instructor at the 2 year college University of New Mexico, Los Alamos. When I was a graduate student, I did stuff involving Cstar-algebras. While I'm not a research mathematician (anymore?), I am interested in the relationship between category theory and functional analysis, especially Banach spaces and C*-algebras and the like. Seeing how difficult it is for me to read through everyone's intros, I wonder if this will get lost in the shuffle.</p>

<p>I'm Conor McBride when I'm being British, but I'm also Irish. I'm a dependently typed functional programmer with an increasingly categorical bent. In the past I have noticed a peculiar inability to learn category theory. Fortunately, I can be co-learned by category theory. It keeps showing up in the things that I'm doing, and I can't help thinking I could be doing them more deliberately.</p>

<p>I became interested in  category theory when exploring the algebraic topology of wild spaces X such as the Hawaiian earring, with particular attention paid to the choice of topology for the corresponding homotopy groups. TOP is often an unsuitable  category for such exploration due the general failure in TOP of the product of two sequential spaces to be sequential.  Working in a different category such as SEQ turns a bug (failure to be a topological group in TOP) into a feature.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276646">Max Wall</span>! Just curious as to what you're aware about applications of CT in these two areas. For data integration, did you have in mind the data migration of Spivak et al's FQL? For probabilistic programming language semantics, that's new to me, any pointers to the literature you've seen? Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>. Indeed! We had David come speak to us about his work in this area, and I've been puttering around with CQL. Hoping to turn it into more than just puttering with the Conexus folks. As for the prob prog semantics, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Adam Sciobor does work in this area (see his thesis), and while it may not be semantics outright, I'm also including work on differentiable programming like Conel Elliot's "Compiling with Categories", and Sam Staton's recent work (papers: POPL 2019, FOSSACS 2020). </p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm a statistician by training.  I became interested in category theory by a couple of paths a few months ago, and it's been uphill ever since. I use <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229450" href="/#narrow/stream/229450-functional-programming">#functional programming</a> ideas a lot in my work as a statistical programmer using R and Haskell at NoviSci (<a href="https://www.novisci.com" title="https://www.novisci.com">https://www.novisci.com</a>).

<p>Hi, I am Aleksandar Bakic, started reading on applied and computational CT some 20 years ago from the Kestrel Institute papers. Some time later started coding up the pieces I learned in Common Lisp, as I started memorizing less and less. Recently read Seven Sketches, Functorial Data Migration and have been finishing an implementation of Left Kan Extension "directly" by stitching diagrams (using general algorithms, not chase). I work at a startup on unrelated things, have little time for chatting; mostly reading and sometimes coding alone.</p>

<p>Hi y'all, I'm Mario Alvarez, recently finished a PhD at Oxford where I used incremental computation as an excuse to do "differential calculus" on discrete spaces. I like programming languages and their (categorical) semantics, Coq, machine learning and the intersection of all of the above. Currently trying to figure out an abstract machine for reverse-mode AD, integration for change actions, and how differential equations and iteration are the same if you squint hard enough.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. I'm Patrick Elliott - I'm a visiting faculty member in the linguistics and philosophy department at MIT; I did my PhD in the linguistics department at University College London. I'm a theoretical semanticist, interested in using ideas from category theory and functional programming to model our knowledge of meaning, with a focus on the logical aspects of the latter. I write haskell, occasionally for work, and also for fun, and I'm interested in learning more about Idris, Agda, and dependently-typed programming languages more generally.  SInce this literature is probably unfamiliar to most of you, here's a recent paper I wrote using the Reader monad to model a certain kind of environment sensitivity in natural language! <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107" title="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107">https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107</a></p>

<p>Hi, I'm Gabo, an undergraduate student from Buenos Aires, Argentina who wants to do a PhD in math, maybe Applied Category Theory if fate permits. I chose to study Physics because I was interested in complex systems, but the usual complex systems work stemming from Physics doesn't have the right level of abstraction for me. My Physics undergraduate degree is extremely long (7 years on average) and has a very inflexible curriculum, so I feel like I've already specialized in something I didn't want to, which... Sucks? It makes me feel that, given my true interests, I "should already know" so many things that I don't... Also no one knows what "Applied Category Theory" is around here, and I haven't had the courage to talk with the few people who do work with categorical things. Anyway, I've been learning some stuff on my own, and even thinking about how to apply CT to a project I've been working on (about finite state automata). I hope to keep learning and perhaps be honored with some useful advice <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>Hi all! I graduated last year (Aug 2019) with a Bachelor's in CS. My research was mostly in canonical CS stuff like complexity theory, algorithm analysis, cryptography and computational geometry during my bachelor's. Then, I spent few months at Microsoft Research. </p>
<p>For my bachelor's thesis I made a switch to computational condensed matter, out of sheer curiosity towards Physics, and have been hooked since. I am now at Prof. Franco Nori's group (Theoretical Quantum Physics Group) in RIKEN, Japan as a funded research assistant for the last six months, and I will spend the rest of this year here as well.</p>
<p>My introduction to Category Theory was through following the work of Prof. Bob Coecke in the Foundations, Structures and Quantum group at Oxford (which I feel is doing some phenomenal work at the intersection of theoretical CS and physics). After this year I plan to apply for a PhD, so hopefully I can find something of interest here!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm James,  a conjoint at the University of Newcastle of Newcastle, Australia. As an economist with a passion for philosophy (in particular, Schelling, Deleuze, Whitehead, Peirce), I am interested in applications of category theory to macroeconomics, ecological economics, network analysis and, in this era of ubiquitous 'fake news', in finding more democratic modes of communication, cooperative alternatives to private property, and more decentralized and transparent governance structures. One aspect of this is would be the deployment of diagrammatic reasoning (especially, string diagrams) to regain control over machines for as Marx  observed, "The hand tool makes the worker independent –posits him as proprietor. Machinery – as fixed capital – posits him as dependent, posits him as appropriated."</p>

<p>Hi, I am Soichiro Fujii, a postdoc at Kyoto University. I am interested in various topics related to category theory, and have worked on a unified framework for various notions of algebraic theory (Lawvere theories, operads, monads, ...) based on monoidal categories, and higher dimensional category (à la Batanin and Leinster).</p>

<p>Hello everyone! <br>
Maxime Lucas here! I am a postdoc at the University of Nantes, France, where I am trying to understand what is going on in HoTT.  Apart from that I am working on so-called "higher dimensional rewriting": it turns out that you can use (somewhat) elementary rewriting  techniques to compute resolutions of most of your favorite algebraic objects : algebras, operads, etc ! <br>
It also allows you to prove some "coherence results" <em>à la</em> MacLane, of the type "every diagram commutes"</p>

<p>Here are three references, depending on what you like: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Church Rosser property and homology of monoids</em>  is the most elementary, but contains the basic idea.</li>
<li><em>Polygraphic resolutions and homology of monoids</em> is a very good introduction to the subject. It is not state-of-the-art, but it at least uses state-of-the art terminology, which I guess is useful before advancing in the litterature.</li>
<li><em>Convergent presentations and polygraphic resolutions of associative algebras</em> is the state of the art for algebras, which is probably one of the most useful application. If you know some stuff about Grobner basis, this paper also shows how they are a particular case of higher dimensional rewriting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you want to know more :)</p>

<p>I'm thinking about cognitively inspired program induction!  In particular, humans are often able to quickly see what sort of program is needed to solve a problem --- associative thinking from remembered previous solutions helps narrow the search space.  How can we get computers to write programs from examples using similar learned heuristics?  I sort of just started, though, so this is more a dream than progress.</p>
<p>Before working on that, I was shopping for advisors and doing theoretical machine learning.  I developed some "feynman diagrams" for analyzing stochastic gradient descent, and i hope my work gets accepted this year! {Nervous}</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I'm Reuben (they/them) and I'm finishing my undergrad in math at Harvard this semester. In math, I study homotopy theory, so I'm a user of higher category theory. Recently, my interests have been relating to factorization homology and (secondary) algebraic K-theory. I'm also tangentially interested in categorical logic. </p>
<p>I'll be "leaving math" to pursue a career in orchestral conducting (starting a masters program at the Peabody Conservatory), but I hope to stay in touch with the community :) Once you've spent a long time caring about something, it's impossible to stop caring! So while I may not contribute much, I'm so excited to see the mathematics I care about evolve.</p>

<p>Hello friends old and new! I'm a theoretical neuroscience PhD student at Oxford, though I don't like that classification: I'm interested in all kinds of structure, and particularly the structure of our ideas and of systems that might be said to have ideas. So I'm working on a few related projects: a compositional formulation of the "free energy" or "active inference" framework for intelligent systems in the setting of categorical cybernetics; a study of the simplicial structure of certain models of spatial navigation in the hippocampus; and more generally trying to understand the abstract logical structure of the neural code. I call the overarching topic "compositional cognitive cartography": I want to understand how we (and other creatures) explore all kinds of spaces, be they physical or abstract (another distinction that I dislike).</p>
<p>I do like the notion of 'deep' and 'codeep' as adjoint approaches to applied category theory. I'm starting on the 'codeep' side, trying to tunnel deeper. A slightly unfortunate side effect of this is that I've built up a backlog of "<a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223" title="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223">papers in drawers</a>" which I really need to write up. I hope to share some of those with you all soon. My feeble excuse is that I prefer working with pencil and paper to working with keyboard and screen.</p>
<p>On the methodological side, I'm attempting to introduce concepts and techniques from theoretical computer science into computational neuroscience (which embarrassingly lacks a notion of 'neural computation'). More generally, these days I repudiate much of the current structure of (scientific) academia into "disciplines" which often seem to bear little relation to the abstract structure of the objects of study.

<p>Hello friends old and new! I'm a theoretical neuroscience PhD student at Oxford, though I don't like that classification: I'm interested in all kinds of structure, and particularly the structure of our ideas and of systems that might be said to have ideas. So I'm working on a few related projects: a compositional formulation of the "free energy" or "active inference" framework for intelligent systems in the setting of categorical cybernetics; a study of the simplicial structure of certain models of spatial navigation in the hippocampus; and more generally trying to understand the abstract logical structure of the neural code. I call the overarching topic "compositional cognitive cartography": I want to understand how we (and other creatures) explore all kinds of spaces, be they physical or abstract (another distinction that I dislike).</p>
<p>I do like the notion of 'deep' and 'codeep' as adjoint approaches to applied category theory. I'm starting on the 'codeep' side, trying to tunnel deeper. A slightly unfortunate side effect of this is that I've built up a backlog of "<a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223" title="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223">papers in drawers</a>" which I really need to write up. I hope to share some of those with you all soon. My feeble excuse is that I prefer working with pencil and paper to working with keyboard and screen.</p>
<p>On the methodological side, I'm attempting to introduce concepts and techniques from theoretical computer science into computational neuroscience (which embarrassingly lacks a notion of 'neural computation'). More generally, these days I repudiate much of the current structure of (scientific) academia into "disciplines" which often seem to bear little relation to the abstract structure of the objects of study. So I also hope to contribute to the effort towards more robust and ecological (more 'autopoietic') structures both in technology and society. Thanks to everyone for building this community!</p>

<p>That's who I meant! He's one of my best friends. He was using tools from algebraic topology to describe what happens in the brain. I told him more than once that probably category theory would be a nice tool to employ is his research, but I doubt he ever looked into it</p>

<p>Hi Toby! A couple of people I know have recently been inspired by the simplicial structure of models of spatial navigation to come up with a higher version of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer</a> ANN architecture in machine learning:</p>

<p>I agree that the distinction between physical and abstract spaces is not really a distinction: there is evidence to suggest we transfer our intuition about distances in physical spaces onto abstract spaces.</p>

<p>There is a prejudice, which goes back to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0">1989 polemic by a well-known biologist</a>, that computer science cannot inform neuroscience because ANNs are unrealistic. With the benefit of hindsight, this prejudice was founded upon the incomplete knowledge of our brain, and even the name "neuroscience" is a relic of that ignorance. So it is perhaps not surprising that there hasn't been a notion of "neural computation" yet.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>: thanks for that link -- I hadn't seen that generalization of the transformer.

<blockquote>

<p>The evidence on this is actually very strong, not just behaviourally but also at the neural level, and I suspect that the abstract notion of "space" -- as a place where stuff happens plus some notions of restriction and gluing -- is actually ontologically prior. But I'm verging on a Platonist.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Labelling this as a prejudice is a step in the right direction, but actually I go a bit further: theoretical computer science, and especially the parts that cross-pollinate with information theory and statistical physics, supplies a lot of very useful conceptual tools to understand "computation" generally (roughly as a kind of dynamics with semantics), and these go well beyond what most lay people (and indeed neuroscientists) think of as "a computer". It is this rather general type of tool and concept that I'm interested in.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>: very interesting. That toolkit will soon prove very useful in a very broad swathe of neuroscience -- there's even a subfield called "integrative neuroscience" -- and I've recently spent a lot of time studying it. I don't really do any data analysis. My interests are in the theoretical side, both with respect to "how we navigate spaces" (from paths to proofs), and also with respect to notions of natural computation, information-processing in complex systems, and cybernetics broadly.</p>
<p>As many of us have, I've been thinking increasingly about the question of "how to do scientific modelling" and "how to specify models" in such a way that we can translate models across disciplines (as they exist today). At the same time, I think we could do with better tools to assist this: how should this data be represented digitally? How is it represented inside the brain?</p>
<p>Because mathematical spaces are (for me at least) prototypical, I'm trying to figure out how, by stealing ideas from homotopy type theory, we could think about how we navigate (eg) from the premises to the conclusion of a logical deduction. The paper written at the end is a physical artefact witnessing that journey, but along the way the route must have been represented and planned inside the author's brain. And somehow this route should correspond to the abstract witness that exists in some model of type theory.</p>
<p>Anyhow thanks for the connection: I'll send you both an e-mail :)</p>

<p>Hi Rohit! DFT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy">density functional theory</a>) sounds fascinating (I thought it was "discrete Fourier transform" at first). Could you say a little bit more about it?</p>
<p>There's been some tentative steps towards applying CT to ML/AI.

<p>Hello! I'm Nick. I'm an engineer who works as an embedded programmer and electronics designer. I'm mostly an appreciator of ideas. Some things that interest me on the theoretical leaning side: (applied) category theory, PL theory, algebraic statistics, tensor networks, computer vision, control theory.</p>

<p>Hi all! I'm Pablo. I'm a student from ENS and Cambridge. I just finished my master degree and am taking a year to learn category theory better before doing a phd. I am very interested in foundations of math and of category theory, in higher category theory, (homotopy) type theory, and also just category theory as itself. I'm still trying to find my way in math but I know that those subjects really attract me. I'm working on a few personal projects. To cite a few of my recent interests: I've been recently fascinated by limit doctrines, by codensity monads, by (what I just discovered may be called) directed homotopy type theory, and by necessary conditions for a sheafification existence theorem.</p>

<p>Hi all! I'm Philipp. I am an economist and interested in applying category theory to economics, mostly game theory and choice theory. In the last years, I have been working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span>  on compositional game theory. I am also interested in functional programming.</p>

<p>Univalence is Id(x, y) ≃ (x = y).<br>
Directed univalence is Hom(x, y) ≃ (x → y), where Hom is a thing every type has (like Id), but in the case of a universe, lines up with the (non-dependent) function type. In general, it gives a one-way notion of transportability. In set-level mathematics (or rather, poset-level mathematics), I imagine that it works as a way of enforcing monotonicity over some type.</p>

<p>The conversation subsequently morphed into how to process automatically the vast amount of information currently stored in scientific publications into some sort of semantic network (both within the paper itself and with other papers), and how this can facilitate better quality control and assurance in scientific publishing.</p>

<p>I'm a CS prof who was formally educated as a mathematician (specializing in analysis and complex dynamics), worked professionally in symbolic computation (Maple) for 11 years, before returning to academia. I'm extremely interested in 'mechanized mathematics'. As should be no surprise to anyone here, meta-mathematics is full of categorical "stuff", which I'm trying hard to leverage to good use. I have gotten bitten hard (in a good way) by a few things in the last few years: category theory, dependent types and meta-programming. One day, I will manage to stuff all 3 in the same paper.</p>

<p>Hi. My name's Dean and I'm finishing a degree in mathematical physics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. I recently just submitted a dissertation in semigroup theory, where most of the research I did into the literature of the subject involved abstract notions from category theory.  At my confusion, I decided to begin learning some. So here I am. :^)</p>

<p>I work as a researcher at a trading firm. I used to be a grad student proving theorems about quantum computing. Now my academic interests cluster around the question "how do we leverage technology to accelerate mathematics research, including via new communication methods and via changing incentive structures?" I hang out a lot on the leanprover chat. </p>
<p>I'm currently thinking about approaches to tame the constructions of MIP* = RE using categories. (To give a sense of what stage it's at, I have a category of "games" and "simulations" such that the product and coproduct in this category correspond to some of the constructions in the CS literature. I haven't yet proven that the natural map from games to C^*-algebras is functorial. I think that the "introspection game" from the MIP^* = RE paper will end up being an exponential object in this category.)</p>

I'm currently a postdoc and work on information theory, probability theory, quantum mechanics, and occasionally other areas like differential geometry, algebraic topology, and condensed matter, though less in recent years. Lately, I've been thinking about Bayes' theorem in a quantum context, and I spend a lot of time doing linear algebra. It's amazing to see so many people here!</p>

<p>Not to be overly negative, but my interests now are different from what they were when I was working on those, and I think that unfortunately Nuprl-style type theory can have zero application to my current areas of interest, both for some simple reasons that are well-understood and for some complex reasons that are poorly understood. I don't have time to go into it right now though.</p>

<p>I have great respect for the Nuprl project as one of the first serious type theoretic proof assistants, and also because they came up with a lot of ideas that are now "standard" and whose origins are sadly forgotten. The specifics of Nuprl, though, are maybe best left to the shadows of history and a better way to pay it respect is to follow in the legacy by creating new and fun tools based on type theory.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I don't want to be sectarian about this and start painting people into corners ;-) All I will say is that for the kinds of questions I am currently interested in, the main leverage of category theory for me has been in the emphasis of universal properties and distinguishing the parts of disciplines-of-application that require some creativity from the aspects that are "trivially trivial" (a matter of paperwork).</p>
<p>Category theory is also amazingly well-adapted as a language for organizing complex structures that are not universal, and this aspect of the application of category theory (often under the banner of compositionality) is a fast-growing and fascinating area of research about which I am not currently an expert.</p>

<p>I'd also like to point out that there is an intersection between the "universal property" style of CT and monoidal structures,  one can use tools from formal CT to study monoidal structures in Cat. a nice example is this note about <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/Notes/daytensor.pdf" title="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/Notes/daytensor.pdf">2-categorical day convolution</a>, and also the constructions related to <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/Publications/generalised-species.pdf" title="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/Publications/generalised-species.pdf">generalised species</a>.

<p>Yes, there's a lot of overlap and there will be more in the future.   For example, my more recent work on networks starts using "universal property" ideas more heavily:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Baez and Kenny Courser, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630">Structured cospans</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Already using left adjoints instead of lax monoidal functors makes structured cospans easier to set up than decorated cospans.  But the serious business starts when we show structured cospans are morphisms in a weak category internal to Rex, the 2-category of finitely cocomplete categories and right exact functors.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum codes, which is a subfield of quantum computing. It's generally accepted that quantum computers will eventually need to use some kind of codes to protect the precious qubits. By another example of the weird efficacy of mathematics in physics, the most promising quantum code comes from (is?) the cellular homology of a 2-dimensional manifold. And this idea overlaps with condensed matter physics: such a "code" can be seen as a simple example of a 2d topological quantum field theory. So while I wait for someone to actually build one of these things, I get to think about a lot of cool mathematics, much of which involves category theory.</p>
<p>I also have a semi-regular collaboration going on with James Dolan. James is interested in categorified algebraic geometry, homotopy theory and the Langlands program. These big ideas are so big, possibly eating all of mathematics, I have a suspicion that they also have a lot to do with quantum computing. We will see.</p>

<p>Hi all, it's nice to see a vibrant community here, random science discussions are among the things I miss the most these days! <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>
<p>I am a phd student at the Perimeter Institute. Broadly speaking, I am interested in abstracting techniques and methods used in (quantum) information theory, both for the purposes of better understanding the physics, but also more generally to map out the science methodology at play. A bit more specifically, I think about resource theories, as they offer a nice way to understand physics from a more agent-centric and less reductionist perspective, in contrast to the classic narratives. As such, I would like to extract the lessons learned in this context and see where they lead.</p>
<p>Other than that, I am also interested in causal inference, both in the classical and quantum domain.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Nikolaj Kuntner. I usually say I got a PhD in physics (officially it's in aerospace engineering, practically it's in plasma chemistry, but I did my masters in something like Riemannian geometry derived from Matrix models). I currently work in computer vision for a US company, so I might be responsible for the SO(3)-representation elements being multiplied on your phone once you turn on some apps. Funfact, to compute the opening angle of a rotation it might pass from a 4-component quaternion to a 3x3-rotation matrix, simply because the relevant functions are already there and the risk of messing something up by attempting to map from the quaternion to the angle directly are not worth it. I have a vlog (<a href="https://youtu.be/E7V36JvHbsA">https://youtu.be/E7V36JvHbsA</a>), implementing this and that, trying to be a little more general and explicit about the underlying theory that's used. I interacted with a lot of people here before, on the nForum, or the distributed computing space, etc., but I also see a lot of names now that I don't know, so here's my Introduce Yourself.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I am Joscha Diehl from Greifswald (<a href="https://diehlj.github.io/">https://diehlj.github.io/</a>). Coming from Stochastic Analysis I'm interested in (noncommutative) algebras since they serve as book-keeping devices for various things there (the prime example being iterated integrals). This year I am looking into operads and homological algebra, to get a broader view on things. Happy to discuss noncommutative, nonassociative algebras, operads, as well as TDA!</p>

<p>Hey all. I'm a data scientist with a electrical engineering background (information theory, graph theory, bayesian statistics) with a pretty weak background in category theory and abstract math in general; I've always been an applications first person. I've found that my intuitions often line up with abstractions from category theory, but that I don't always have the mathematical language to realize that! I'm working through Riehl, Fong, and Spivak's books in order to rectify that terminology gap and so I can understand the elegance of some results from category theory more formally.</p>
<p>Domains that I'm interested in that I think category theory can bring some nice abstractions to: include causal inference/ probabilistic graphical models and network theory (especially directed hypergraphs, networks of oscillators, complex adaptive systems). I'm particularly interested in the applications to meta-science (think <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction">https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction</a>) and to dynamical systems work in computational epidemiology, biology, and neuroscience. As such, super interested in sheaf theory, topos theory, hodge theory,  and (stochastic) petri nets. I've been eagerly playing with the tools built by James Fairbanks (and the rest of the Julia community) and reading all the work from Fong, Spivak, Tuyveras, Baez, and now Evan Patterson's thesis in a hand-wavey fashion, and hoping to go back later with some more rigor.</p>

<p>Hi, I did a PhD in motivic homotopy theory, but have been skipping around Homotopy type theory, non-classical propositional logics, the outskirts of number theory, like quadratic forms and the field with one element. And I love topos theoy!  I just became a lecturer in computer science at Düsseldorf, Germany. I am not much of a computer scientist yet, but I am trying to become a valuable member of my department (or at least not the lamest duck) - so I want to learn about Topological Data Analysis, and all kinds of applications of category theory in computer science. Especially if they are AI or data science related. I don't think many people in my department know what a category is, so I am grateful for story lines that start in very concrete computer science situations and lead naturally and/or successfully to category theory...</p>

Our hope, at Cavenwell AI, is that Category Theory, and especially it's role in the foundation of data science, can help companies automatically learn the overall theory for their products, be they physical or software systems.   I liken the application of Cavenwell AI to industrial settings to that point in the history of science between the basic work on understanding electricity and the development of Maxwell's Equations.  Companies do not have concise theories for their products.  Rather, they have the application of the myriad of scientific disciplines to localized facets of their products.  We hope to empower their scientists and engineers to more completely understand, and thus improve, their products.  </p>
<p>Thank you for asking!!</p>

<p>Hi Timothy! Welcome! I took a short course with Stephen when he was one of the lecturers, together with Mark Kisin, in the Algebraic Structures stream of the inaugural AMSI Winter School at the University of Queensland back in 2004. I think he taught some representation theory and Mark taught some number theory. Good times!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a software engineer interested in functional programming and type theory. I know a little bit of category theory and joined this server to participate in discussions in the new categorical statistics reading group: I've got interested in statistics quite recently after finding out that causal inference is a thing and getting really interested in it. Since the idea of making connections to other areas is really appealing to me, I would like to learn how category theory applies to this area.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I am a 2nd year PhD student in Mathematics at IISER, Thiruvananthapuram, India. I am learning Higher Gauge Theory and Higher Geometry mainly from the work of <em>Baez, Schreiber , Waldorf, Wockel, Bartels, Jurco, Nikolaus among others.</em> Recently I started working on a problem in this area. Till now I am only using the  ideas of upto 2-categories. But in future I want to use the ideas of Higher categories i.e n-categories and infinity categories in my work . I have seen some papers which uses the higher categorical ideas but currently I am not equipped well with the machineries needed to understand those concepts. I am trying to learn infinity categories from <em>Kerodon (Lurie)</em> but I am feeling it is very dense and it will take a long time for me to understand these higher categorical ideas. I am also reading parts of <em>Introduction to Language of Stacks and Gerbes by Moerdijk</em> suggested from <em>An Invitation to Higher Gauge Theory by Baez and Huerta</em> to understand about Non trivial 2 -bundles.  Also I am interested in Homotopy theory and Model categories. <strong>Lastly I am very much interested in using the abstract ideas of Pure Mathematics to tackle Real World Problems. So Learning some Category Theory and Learning how to apply ideas of the same in Real World are my greatest motivation to join this community.</strong></p>

<p>Hello everyone. I'm an Asst Prof in Physics working at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) India. I work in quantum gravity and high energy theory. I favor the Loop Quantum Gravity approach over String Theory, though I'm working on understanding their similarities and connections. My interest in Category theory started as a curiosity as an undergrad some 17 years ago, but only matured into a serious interest  over the past couple of years when I realized that it can possibly provide a unifying language for quantum gravity. I also write a blog at <a href="https://www.quantumofgravity.com/blog">https://www.quantumofgravity.com/blog</a> on various topics in high energy physics.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I am a fresh (1 week) PhD student with UTS in Australia. I have a background in education / mathematics and I've been delving into Learning Analytics and various educational data sets. I'm hoping to apply CT to the problem of context in an analysis / study - so basically if the framework of CT can help articulate the issues of moving between spaces like the 'real world' and 'data' and if what is lost / gained along the way has implications for trust in the end result. I feel like just the language of CT might help, but I'm also hoping that it might be applicable enough to solve some problems directly. (Just caught 1/2 of the tutorial day for ACT2020 and it was excellent)</p>

While I’m enthusiastic about many things, my current focus is on modelling living systems. My thesis project involves characterising the proteome (the set of proteins and their interactions) in yeast cells. A parallel (and more long-term) interest is in bridging / reconciling different types of models and frameworks.</p>

<p>I'm a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur (India) My majors is Material Science, but in the last four years I've dabbled a lot, from theoretical condensed matter physics (clean and random Ising), Knot Theory(Khovanov Homology, Ribbon Categories), Gauge Theory (fibre bundles formulation, leading up to getting polynomial invariants from Chern Simmons); TQFTs (Entanglement Entropy calculations using the Atiyah definition of TQFT), classification of defects (using Homotopy Theory, inspired form Mermin's result), one constant in all projects or readings I undertook and even currently am is Category Theory. Since, I'm an Engineer by degree (just graduated) doing so much CT made me feel different from the rest of my class. I am also very driven towards Cognitive Science and Neuroscience and I keep looking for bridges and ways CT can be made a language neuroscientists can think in, (in my dreams I feel this will bring Grothendieck like revolution to the field) So far I've found some works which try to aim in the direction by Gomez Ramirez, Brown and Porter, Andrée Ehresmann. But, I feel very anxious because I don't know where do I fit in and if I will be able to contribute as much I feel driven to, further in academia. <br>
I can't even ascertain the departments I should apply to for Grad school, especially given the COVID scenario, the uncertainty has increased many-fold (manifold? anyone) When I came across this conference, thanks to the smart AI of Google who learned from my searches and recommended ACT2020 in my feed, I was delighted. This is the best thing to experience sitting at home. Thanks to the organizers. <br>
I would love to have any pointers from anyone present here as to how I (as an engineer, who used to make flexible printed electronics) should go forward touching neuroscience and physics simultaneously with CT sword in my hard (which needs a lot of brushing, sharpening because in this group I probably know the least CT).</p>

<p>Hi! I have just finished my undergrad in Physics and Masters in mathematics at IIT Kanpur, India. I have been reading diverse things in the CT landscape including synthetic differential geometry, HoTT, higher gauge theory, TQFT (my Master's thesis was on the Cobordism Hypothesis and implications of it) as well more traditional topics in math and physics such as AdS/CFT and other stuff in Algebraic Topology and Algebraic Geometry. I've been learning the machinery of  <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories from various sources.

<p>Hi Alex! I am Adittya, currently a 2nd Year Phd student from India working in the area of Higher Gauge Theory .  I especially liked  <em>"I’m interested in math pedagogy and human/social processes.

It would be a real pleasure if you kindly share about your views/thoughts in this regard! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm Erik and I'm a software developer at Statebox based near Amsterdam. I got interested in CT through functional programming, and have been hooked since I first learned what a functor was.</p>
<p>To throw out some things I'm interested in: programming languages and methods, computation, databases, music, literature, forest walks, many things medieval, petting sufficiently small animals, and lately also topology and assorted topics in economics, physics, etc.</p>
<p>I've met a good number of you around Oxford, Schoorl, Tallinn, Berlin, etc. and it's been a pleasure. It's very nice to see familiar names and faces around here, as well as unfamiliar ones, and I look forward to lurking around and talking morphisms and whatnot.</p>

<p>In a set theory course at Columbia University in around 1967, my friend Nick Yus introduced me to category theory via algebraic topology. A couple of years later, Ralph Abraham introduced me to Lawvere (in a Parisian pub). In 1968 I audited a course on category theory given by Samuel Eilenberg. In Summer 1969 I attended the Summer Seminar in Category Theory at Bowdoin College, where I attended the lectures by Saunders Mac Lane (where he presented my example of continuous map as an adjunction). By Fall 1969 I was enrolled as a student of Lawvere at Dalhousie University. My best friend was Radu Diaconescu. I did <em>not</em> impress Lawvere much at all, and I went over to be mentored by Barry Mitchell. We became friends over ensuing decades, mostly by telephone. A couple of years ago he said, "You know, back then you were not as good as you thought you were." This sort of hurt my feelings, except that I do not recall thinking myself as good at mathematics. Enthusiastic, way yes, quick-minded, not. I am still enthusiastic. My passion is to categorize my choice of modern theoretical biology, the part of systems biology that leaves genetic reductionism aside, and moves to the realm of biological autonomy. The first step is to take care of adequately explaining micro and macro thermodynamics. Then there is the matter of explicating a recent foundational principle called "closure of constraints."</p>

<p>Hello, I'm from the industry side, in software. Currently working at <a href="http://rjginc.com">rjginc.com</a> where we enable process analysis and machine control for plastic injection molding. Besides some java programming, mostly what I'm doing day to day is designing software systems and helping coordinate between teams. Long time fan of functional programming, written some (very basic) Haskell. So I'm glad to have found Bartosz Milewski's blog and videos to work through. I'm inclined to learn category theory so I can finally understand haskell :P, and also inspired by things like the Azimuth project, and plus its just fun.<br>

Big fan of NixOS, a GNU/Linux distro composed of software packages defined in the nix language (<a href="https://nixos.org/">https://nixos.org/</a>). Highly recommend it, if you have trouble managing software dependencies. This way you can have those same problems but at a higher level :) also if you are more free software or LISP minded, there is <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">https://guix.gnu.org/</a></p>

<p>This is my first time saying anything here, so "Introduce Yourself" seems appropriate. I'm Joe. This server is an incredible resource.</p>
<p>Also, I have a question, but I'm unsure where to put it, so I'll leave it to a moderator to categorize. My question is, why does the diagram for equalizers differ from the diagram you get when you create it by taking the limit of a formal diagram, i.e., a functor? This is the typical diagram for equalizers:</p>
<p><a href="user_uploads/21317/velk54sR-jG2i33G6mHknr96/IMG_0174.PNG">IMG_0174.PNG</a></p>

<p><a href="user_uploads/21317/SquhiZelvCrJaXO0PE_QyZ0q/IMG_0175.PNG">IMG_0175.PNG</a></p>

<p>As a side note, I find it interesting that the syntactical representation of the categorical product distinguishes both targets of the cone legs. That is, in the product A x B, both constituent objects appear. This allows us to define the functors like - x B, which is left adjoint to the exponential (_)^B. Equalizers, on the other hand, are not syntactically represented as the composite of two objects.</p>

<p>If we make the index category just two objects with a single morphism between them, we get this diagram,</p>

In Set, it looks like the limit is the set of pairs (x, f(x)), i.e., a function. It's as if the additional f: X -&gt; Y morphism constrains the product set X x Y to the subset where elements are (x, f(x)). Adding more morphisms then constrains the pairs to be (x, f(x) = g(x) = ... = z(x)), for all morphisms f, g, ..., z: X -&gt; Y.</p>

<p>Hello!! , This is Krisna. I am software system engineer by day - more inclined towards multi-disciplinary system with human centered design in mind. Predominantly, Java/Python and bit of Haskell/Go. Have been reading and enriching myself through - <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/</a> and recent read about <a href="https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf">https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf</a> - Category Theory for programmers was quiet fascinating. Exploring the limits and possibilities of self-expressive and self-aware software systems - through semiotics , ACT etc .</p>

<p>I am a software developer.  However, while the practical side of CT is of course interesting to me, I would like to learn about it from a mathematical point of view as a subject in its own right.  My interest in mathematics comes from its own inherent beauty.</p>
<p>However, I only have books and the occasional video to teach myself.  I have been told I'm intelligent, but all my more mature mathematics has been self-taught (beyond what I learned in University where I was an Engineering student, which was mostly linear algebra applied to signal processing) and sometimes I get stuck and, admittedly, a little obstinate.  I am the proverbial baby learning how to crawl.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure this is the right place for me, but let's see how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Originally a physicist working on quantum optics, moved over to Astrophysics for my PhD, completed a postdoc on the same field, later got a faculty job which I eventually left to work on the healthcare industry. I came in contact with CT a couple of years ago and have been learning on my own ever since. Been through a couple of books,  occasional papers and a few vids, which left me with: tons of unanswered questions and no one to help me solve them.</p>
<p>Really glad to be here, looks like the place I've been looking for</p>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>I am finishing my CS undergraduate degree and already started taking some classes for a mathematics master's degree. I always loved programming languages and last year finally got around to implementing one. This little rabbit hole led me to learn about Haskell, lambda calculus, and type theory. Now I can say I have a new passion for proof assistants, category theory, and type theory. I am still very much a beginner and very enthusiastic about that!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is where I talk about category theory... I talk about many other things on my blog <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/">Azimuth</a>, and these days I'm talking about nonstandard models of arithmetic on Michael Weiss' blog <a href="https://diagonalargument.com/">Diagonal Argument</a>, and other math questions on <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">The n-Category Cafe</a>.   Maybe I should make it a bit easier to find everything in one place.</p>

There are conversations here on that topic, such as this one on <a href="#narrow/stream/232163-learning.3A-history.20of.20ideas/topic/HOTT.20Book">the HoTT book</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a HoTT zulip, though, where questions about HoTT might find a higher ratio of interested folks.  The HoTT book does assume more category theory background than would be ideal, and category theory is a very useful tool in type theory, but the subjects are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Isn't that easily explained by mathematically inclined programmers being interested in it?<br>
(I remember people getting their knickers in a twist for an array of reason, when some others on twitter where posting about how hard category theory is, along with screenshots of their notes on modular arithmetic and Lagrange's theorem)</p>

<p>It is not clear what you are responding to, and so what your 'it' refers to. I'll assume it is the previous post in the "Introduce Yourself!" thread, and in particular the sentence " It's the only thing that can explain how it is possible for Category Theory to be discussed on Twitter." <br>
I think here is is fundamental to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>, which is a very interesting mathematical principle, about the  faster growth in the number of connections on a (telephone,...) network as it adds new nodes, and so the value of the network as a whole. All of silicon valley is built on this. From the internet itself, to the market clout of Microsoft products, to the success of Facebook, etc... It's a mathematical principle they understand and take very seriously. The more users are on a system that is about connections grows, the more value the system gains as a whole, as it is easier to make connections.</p>

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>My background is in computer science, working as a software engineer nowadays. My interest in programming languages (Swift, Go, Rust atm) and type systems led me to category theory. Hoping that theory and practice can meet together to make software easier to develop.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am a designer/developer who turned to category theory after finding a lot of patterns reappearing in different basis in my work. I found out that Category Theory is a great setting to rigorously study patterns in general. To start learning it, I have been looking at various starter materials and collecting the ones I found together to get an understanding for what resources are out there. I put all the great stuff I found together as an annotated bibliography. I am a beginner at this and would love to hear thoughts and feedback from people here on it. This is the repo: <a href="https://github.com/prathyvsh/category-theory-resources">https://github.com/prathyvsh/category-theory-resources</a></p>
<p>It would be lovely if someone can point me to any great resource that I have left out. Also, great to join a focussed platform to discuss about Category Theory and I hope to learn a lot from you all!</p>

<p>If you <em>want</em> to add another reference, I'd suggest the 3-volume book by Borceaux, <em>Handbook of Categorical Algebra</em>.   It's packed with stuff everyone eventually wants to learn if they go far enough in category theory - and despite the title, it's not heavily biased toward "algebra".</p>

<p>Yeah I suppose you mostly have recent books (younger than me) and less so on topoi but instead more CS.</p>

<p>Sets for Mathematics is more so category theory (but with a focus on the category of sets) than traditional ZFC-based set theory. If you're looking for a good logic and set theory text, Peter Johnstone has a very slim (approx. 100 pages) book 'Notes on Logic and Set Theory' .</p>

<p>Hello all <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> .<br>
My name is Kale Evans. I am a Software Engineer. Most notably, I've worked at The MathWorks, and currently Spotify. I am very interested in jumping back into theoretical mathematics, principally via Category Theory, and applying it to a host of real world problems. I am also interested in engaging with all of you. Super happy to be here.</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I am Sacha Ikonicoff, I have finished my PhD last year in Paris, Muriel Livernet was my advisor, and I am starting a postdoc in Calgary with Kristine Bauer. I study algebraic topology and especially algebraic operads, I also studied unstable cohomology and I guess I would be tagged as working in homotopy theory.  Category theorist were my prime interlocutor in Paris, and they still are here, so I am glad to be part of this group. <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>

<p>Hi everyone <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> </p>
<p>It's great to be here and to see so many familiar names <span aria-label="blush" class="emoji emoji-1f60a" role="img" title="blush">:blush:</span> </p>
<p>I sometimes refer to myself as the "jester in the court of kings" being old friends with John Baez and Urs Schreiber going back to the ancient sci.physics.research days (anyone remember that? <img alt=":old-man:" class="emoji" src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/19230.jpg" title="old-man"> ) and the early days of the String Coffee Table and the n-Category Cafe.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my research experience was publishing a preprint with Urs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0407005">Discrete Differential Geometry on Causal Graphs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>back when I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (2004). The work resulted from some things I started in my dissertation in computational electromagnetics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2002).</p>
<p>Sadly (as some might say), I sold my soul and went to work in Wall Street in 2005 and have had a long career in financial services since then, but I always tried to keep one foot in research by publishing occasional informal articles on my <a href="https://phorgyphynance.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>As a mathematician, I am certainly a "fool", but when it comes to engineering (science or finance), I think I don't do too bad. I am pretty sure I can claim to be the first person to ever apply noncommutative geometry to mathematical finance <span aria-label="nerd" class="emoji emoji-1f913" role="img" title="nerd">:nerd:</span> </p>
<p>Six years ago, I left the corporate world and have been on my own working on various startups with some successes and some (painful) failures. Recently, I decided to get back to my old research bridging higher maths with practical applications and am definitely open to collaboration (so don't hesitate to get in touch). </p>
<p>I am somewhat of an evangelist for the Julia programming language and think it has huge potential for applied category theory. I believe a "killer app" is automatic differentiation a la Conal Elliott and <a href="https://sciml.ai/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>. I am active on the Julia Zulip where it has been fun to see world's collide with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> attracting a lot of category theorists over due to the awesome work they are doing on <a href="https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/dev/">Catlab.jl</a> and building up the <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/">AlgebraicJulia</a> community..</p>

<p>hi everyone! Yes, I have been around for a while, but I would like to introduce myself, as I have a favour to ask.<br>
I'm Valeria de Paiva, I work in the Topos Institute and I like to use category theory in many different applications. Now I am very keen on making sure that women are not short-changed in their professional lives and I am very much  against 'manels', panels with only men on them. So, for the favour, I would like to have a list with women in Category Theory.  I would like women here to go to the google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb3zW7Zk-KI0mY0x7dLZ0pHFeLLeobc5itTBrtVBwAo/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb3zW7Zk-KI0mY0x7dLZ0pHFeLLeobc5itTBrtVBwAo/edit#gid=0</a> and add themselves to the list. The rules are very simple: no need for a PhD, no need for a(n academic) position, no need for reputation points. anyone who wants to work with category theory and identify as a woman can add their names, please.</p>

Moerdijk's approach is a bit more semantics based, drawing from NSA directly through the Robinson route in a sense (i.e via the underlying idea of ultrafilter), while Palmgren's constructive NSA uses similar ideas to that of my starting point (E. Nelson's Internal Set Theory).  My main inspiration is actually an old paper by A. Kock and C.J. Mikkelsen; my version uses different tools and is a fundamentally different approach, but it all ends up being topos theory in the end.</p>

<p>hi @Peter, I first worried about the same. Had an exchange almost ten years ago with Catarina Dutilh Novaes, me saying that there would be Viagra ads all over the list of Women in Logic, she saying we'll worry about it when it does and she was right. We haven't had issues, so far. Women in Programming Languages  have their list in GitHub, but  the point here is not to make sure category theorists know how to use github, but to make the old excuse that people don't know women doing CT even more lame. (I don't understand it, as I keep having to remove rubbish from even slideshare comments...)</p>

<p>Adelaide doesn't have a category theory group, let alone topos theory. I'm officially employed on a grant looking at K-theory. Danny Stevenson does homotopy theory/oo-categories. Raymond Vozzo is a differential geometer who works on gerbes. And that's the closest we've got. I recommend Adelaide as a city to live in, but getting an academic job is a different matter. Dom Verity or Richard Garner would have a better idea about options for actual CT jobs in Australia.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm a postdoc at RIKEN CBS (Centre for Brain Science) in Japan.</p>
<p>When it comes to categories,  I'm only just starting, but thanks to people like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276071">@Nathaniel Virgo</span> (who so kindly introduced me to CT and this community) I feel like this may lead me into some really cool topics + ideas. 'Normally', I'm working somewhere between theoretical neuroscience and AI. But also theoretical biology, control theory + inference/filtering + information theory, etc. </p>
<p>I have a keen interest for cross-disciplinary approaches (to any kind of problem really), and for common topics that seem to appear in different fields (it all started with the duality of inference and control, Kalman and many others after him). This is probably the main reason I thought CT would be of great help: what are the fundamental components of all these things that I like and that seem to pop up in apparently unrelated fields?</p>
<p>To give a few key words that might help place me (but don't make me an expert on): </p>
<ul>
<li><em>cybernetics</em>, which I know is a topic already of interest to some here and one of the main reasons for me to like cross-disciplinary ideas (control theory + info theory + neuroscience), </li>
<li><em>active inference</em>, in some sense a modern reading of some topics originating in cybernetics (how do we use <del>info theory</del> inference + control to understand what brains do) over which I worked during my PhD (in some ways also after that), and which is potentially interesting for at least another person here :P (even with all of its problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite likely I'll spend some time just lurking for now, especially in the streams (with questions) for beginners, but in the meantime, nice to meet you all!</p>

<p>Hey, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="403646">@Manuel Baltieri</span>. First of all, welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="403646">@Manuel Baltieri</span>, and thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> for @ing me:  I find this place quite overwhelming so only log in occasionally.  I should say that my ACT talk is somewhat troublesome and I've been working on cleaning it up quite significantly.  I've now got quite a general scheme for describing the structure of active inference systems as an indexed functor from an indexed category of statistical games (describing the statistical part) over polynomials into an indexed category of dynamical systems (of various kinds), also over polynomials.  I don't like to announce things before I'm feeling secure in them, so I haven't said much recently.  But I gave a talk sketching some of this material recently, and the slides are at <a href="https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf">https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf</a> -- that talk didn't cover much of the "active" part of "active inference" (which is where the polynomials come in), and I'm writing that up at the moment.  I also believe that, in 'nice' cases, the indexed functor I mentioned should have a right adjoint which associates to a dynamical system a "canonical statistical game", but I haven't finished working the details of that part out.</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Joe Brucker and I do NLP research with the Lexical Grounding team @ harvard. Before that I worked in Semantic Web; before that, Data Science; before that, on both sides of securities trading in emerging market derivatives (both algo and traditional - over the phone on a desk) if anyone wants to talk about macro-econ or trading decision making. </p>
<p>I got interested in Category Theory by a NeurIPS paper on Natural Graph Networks, and my interest was buttressed by the unique thought processes and undeservedly warm welcomes of Bruno Gavranovic+Elias Judin, and a super interesting discussion I got to attend of the latter 2 plus Bob Coecke + Brendan Fong on Clubhouse. </p>
<p>I’m interested in research in category theory + semantics if anyone is looking for a grunt/collaborator. I know very little, but I have a hunch that there are a lot of useful applications in FrameNet, PropBank, and the work done in Ontology development by Martha Palmer at CU Boulder. </p>
<p>Nice to meet you all!</p>
<p>Edit: I’m also actively looking for research and doctoral positions, and am eligible for citizenship/work in Israel, Germany, Argentina, and the US!</p>

<p>We worked on it a bit, but not much (it's difficult to really think about abstract trading theory in such a bull market!).

<p>This includes using candlesticks, EMAs, RSIs, Volume indicators, you name it. All these constructions can be described neatly in categorical terms.

<p>The _very_ funny thing about trading (that usually makes physicists/dynamical systems people go galaxy brain) is that they work as self fulfilling prophecies: The "dynamical system" at play is just the resultant of the single choices of all traders. So, if, say, everyone uses EMA indicators to make decisions, this choice itself will end up influencing the price, making the EMA indicator being predictive in some sense</p>

<p>for instance, make the unreasonable assumption that everyone starts selling when the daily graph crosses the EMA200 from above. That being the case, said event will inevitably push the price further down. So, detecting this crossing becomes an effective indicator for trend inversion. Clearly the reason why this often does not work in practice is because different traders use different strategies, indicators etc. So you need to properly understand market sentiment to be able to read indicators correctly. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

I'd love to chat! My first startup was a little prop fund that used RSI really heavily, this is really interesting stuff!</p>
<p>You're  <span aria-label="a" class="emoji emoji-1f170" role="img" title="a">:a:</span> bsolutely right that traders spend a ton of time setting up their trading systems - it's why everyone is still stuck in VBA and MS Excel :(  <br>
Categorifying these indicators is a really interesting idea for tool development! IIRC, the black-scholes model is basically a re-wording of some model from physics, so making the ideas more transferrable like you're describing sounds like it has a lot of upside! </p>
<p>When you say untractable, do you mean that it's tough for any one individual trader to move the price? There are also a few different environments  (OTC markets, periods of illiquidity, interbank traders) that the price can move from buying large chunks of stock or from the seller discriminating based on who's buying.  Offline, I can tell you how some traders get around this haha.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking it could also be modeled as discrete, would that make it easier? At an operational level, and depending on the asset/exchange/flow, the price may have artificial 'ceilings' and 'floors' from the limit orders and exchange halting. </p>
<p>The inter-asset/intra-asset self-fulfilling prophecies are all too real, I can still feel the stress of stop-loss slippage. It's really interesting to think of all these price changes as just buy/sell volume proportion at different intervals of time</p>

<p>Hi Valeria, nice to meet you too! And oh wow! I was just reading <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-7205.pdf">your paper on annotations in the SICK corpus</a>- I'm working on an annotation tool for coreference - I'd love to hear how you think about grounding/explicitation of referents for inference, and your work on entailment! Would it be O.K. if I emailed you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395604">@Joe Brucker</span> , we actually have 3 papers on SICK( one on entailments, the one in contradictions you're reading and one about "one-word-apart" pairs of sentences in SICK). I thought in 2016 that SICK would be an easy place to test the new neural nets emerging from Google at that time, the Parsey McParseface times. but we're still working on it 4 years later! oh well.  </p>
<p>Katerina and I have these nice demos for our work: GKR Demo--<br>
<a href="http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/</a> describes our KR system, while Hy-NLI Demo-- <a href="http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--</a> is an overview of our hybrid--neural and symbolic-- inference system, if you're interested. Katerina just defended her PhD in Konstanz. So to your question, we don't ground things explicitly, we use WordNet and a generic ontology SUMO for our concepts. and sure, please email, I'd love to chat more.</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Joe Brucker and I do NLP research with the Lexical Grounding team @ harvard.

I'd love to chat! My first startup was a little prop fund that used RSI really heavily, this is really interesting stuff!</p>
<p>You're  <span aria-label="a" class="emoji emoji-1f170" role="img" title="a">:a:</span> bsolutely right that traders spend a ton of time setting up their trading systems - it's why everyone is still stuck in VBA and MS Excel <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span>  <br>
Categorifying these indicators is a really interesting idea for tool development! IIRC, the black-scholes model is basically a re-wording of some model from physics, so making the ideas more transferrable like you're describing sounds like it has a lot of upside! </p>
<p>When you say untractable, do you mean that it's tough for any one individual trader to move the price? There are also a few different environments  (OTC markets, periods of illiquidity, interbank traders) that the price can move from buying large chunks of stock or from the seller discriminating based on who's buying.  Offline, I can tell you how some traders get around this haha.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking it could also be modeled as discrete, would that make it easier? At an operational level, and depending on the asset/exchange/flow, the price may have artificial 'ceilings' and 'floors' from the limit orders and exchange halting. </p>
<p>The inter-asset/intra-asset self-fulfilling prophecies are all too real, I can still feel the stress of stop-loss slippage. It's really interesting to think of all these price changes as just buy/sell volume proportion at different intervals of time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, by "untractable" I mean that this supposed dynamical system depends on a huge number of variables, basically on all the moves and internal belief system of any trader out there. So it's not something that can be reasonably simulated or analyzed. The best thing you can hope to do is to define some metrics that, for some reason, give approximate predictions for this system</p>

<p>Obviously since things change all the time, some metrics may be predictive in some interval/timeframe, and some may not. The example you make with the RSI is indicative: If you look at markets in crypto on the short timeframes, the RSI is often quite predictive. If you look at the monthly candles of ETH the RSI basically pierces the screen and goes up and up and up weeeeell beyond what any rational human being would consider a reasonable level to buy lol</p>

<p>Hi! My name is William Waites. I belatedly realised that there was an "Introduce Yourself" topic here. I work on things like graph rewriting for studying biological systems -- currently epidemics at LSHTM for somewhat obvious reasons, but previously things like synthetic genetic circuits and vertex models of epithelial tissues (sheets of cells one cell thick). In the more distant past I also did telecommunications engineering and also some semantic web stuff. Despite having been exposed to CT for many years, it's only recently started to sink in and I find that I understand what I have been doing a lot better now. I'm really interested in trying to more systematically bring the insights from the CT understanding of composable open systems to the kind of modelling work that happens in biology and population health. Nice to meet you all!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Tim Campion. I am a 6th year PhD student of Chris Schommer-Pries at the University of Notre Dame. In the fall I will start a postdoc with Emily Riehl at Johns Hopkins University. I am also a moderator at MathOverflow.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as a category theorist at heart who likes to dabble in other mathematical fields while secretly (or not-so-secretly) pretending that they are all category theory. I am particularly interested in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-categories and homotopy theory (which have become roughly synonymous for me). With others, I have done work in cubical homotopy theory, and also work attempting to apply the techniques of categorical homotopy theory to classical model theory.</p>
<p>Between some familiar faces I haven't seen in awhile and unfamiliar faces, I'd like to get to know the folks here better. DM me your favorite universal property!</p>

<p>hi! actually they are just dg-enhancements of derived categories of twisted sheaves and it's a work in progress - hopefully out before the end of this academic year! In any case, I still at least a bit familiar with twisted complexes of objects in dg-categories, there is another work which explores them as a possible variant of projective or injective resolutions</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395604">@Joe Brucker</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="405160">@ww</span> nice to see others with semantic web past here. (We also have <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="390165">@Eric Neumann</span> lurking here and I am sure a few others). <br>
I have been working on the Semantic Web since 2004 and got to see the value of Category Theory by using it programming in Scala starting around 2011. Somehow around 2016 I ended up  taking 4 years off on a (self-financed) PhD which allowed me to study CT deeply, but then ran out of money. Luckily I received funding this year from the EU to work on a project called "Solid Control" where I am writing a Read-Write access controlled web server <a href="https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD">Reactive Solid</a>. This is allowing me to learning by doing, as I try to apply the concepts I read about. (But it is taking a lot of time, as it is milestone based and I set some slightly too ambitious milestones <span aria-label="grimacing" class="emoji emoji-1f62c" role="img" title="grimacing">:grimacing:</span> )<br>
There is a discussion thread <a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/web.20cats">Web Cats</a>, for discussion on Web and Category theory related topics.</p>

<p>Hi everyone - Just want to  introduce myself. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281126">@Henry Story</span>  mentioned, I had been  involved early on with the Semantic Web, focusing on data challenges in HealthCare and Life Sciences (HCLS),  an area that has continued to grow and now finds biotechs awash with complex data and ontologies exhaustion.  More recently, I have been interacting with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276049">@David Spivak</span> on applying CT to areas of biomedicine,  to go beyond just data models  and  try to  build some  foundations for logic and inference in biosystem models. I also plan to participate on <a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/web.20cats">Web Cats</a>  with interest in working on a Comonad definition for the Web.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Zhen Lin Low. I studied category theory at Cambridge and obtained my PhD in 2016. I have been out of academia since then, but it turns out one can never really stop being a mathematician. My research interests include topos theory, categorical logic, and abstract homotopy theory. It seems everything has gone remote/virtual over the last year or so – perhaps I should go to a virtual conference and try to catch up with everyone!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> it's not every day where I have an "Annie Hall" moment with the professor himself right here to disabuse me of my wild misconceptions. So as to not invoke a "you know nothing of my work" moment, how would you characterize the research that has been done so far on a CT interpretation of learning theory? IIRC you were equivocal/skeptical about it, but then there were a few publication that made a convincing case for it (I will move this somewhere else, sorry didn't mean to take up room here).</p>

<p>Hi. I first learned of CT through Haskell. For years my MO has been to read an nlab page, not get it, and months later there's a level-up chime. When I encounter a confusing mathematical object I try to write down all the morphisms I can find, then see if the diagram has a name. I was sent here to ramble as I search for CT foundations for Scott Garrabant's talk on finite factored sets.</p>

<p>I'm super interested in simplicial methods in homological algebra, and now I'm wondering if it relates at all to categorical logic and type theory? or are these two distinct interests?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have the same question. I started studying simplicial methods in homological algebra because monads are a basic structure in computer science logic and categorical semantics, and I wanted to learn about their history and how they originated. So I went back and read a bunch of the early work on this stuff - Godement's book on sheaf cohomology where he shows that you can use simplicial sheaves constructed by the bar resolution of a monad to give simplicial formulas in sheaf cohomology for the cup product/cross product/Steenrod squares, Barr and Beck's work on acyclic models and homological algebra with respect to a monad, stuff like that. It does seem that wherever you have monads you should be able to define some of the basic concepts of simplicial homotopy theory or cohomology, and I am wondering whether it's possible to give an interpretation of these cohomology groups or homotopy groups in the context of the monads arising in computer science logic or formal semantics (an interpretation that would be interesting to computer scientists, I mean.)</p>
<p>I'll mention one specific example of a monad I'm interested in. In Bart Jacobs' book on categorical logic and type theory he gives a very interesting argument that basically all the higher level notions of logic (quantification, equality, logical operators) are ultimately determined by the structural rules of weakening and contraction through some adjunctions related to them. These weakening and contraction operations fit together into a comonad in the category of propositions; this comonad is kind of the logical backbone of the category, as all of the other features of the logic are necessarily determined by it. I would be interested in whether you can define homotopy groups with respect to this comonad which are interesting.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that topos theory has been very influential in categorical logic and type theory, and this also originated in sheaf cohomology theory. It seems like more than a coincidence that both monads and topoi originated in sheaf cohomology specifically and jumped to computer science logic. Surely there is more going on here than the mere coincidence of the same formal structures appearing in both disciplines.</p>
<p>More recently I've begun to think that a lot of the constructions of simplicial homotopy theory or simplicial methods in homological algebra are best understood in terms of monoidal category theory, as the category of simplicial sets is the free cocomplete monoidal category with distinguished monoid, and the category of simplicial Abelian groups is something similar but with Ab-enriched dropped in appropriately throughout, so I have been trying to work out to my own satisfaction sufficiently "monoidal" derivations of many basic notions of simplicial homological algbera.</p>

<p>Very interesting research <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="424412">@Patrick Nicodemus</span> . Thanks for making those connections. I hope I'll get time to follow up on those some time.<br>
Regarding simplicial sets and computing I found the paper "On the Geometry of inutionisic S4 proofs" by Goubault which looks at the geometry of programs, and a later paper (nearly 20 years later) on simplicial sets and epistemology which is easier to read. <a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/web.20cats/near/224017954">links here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm happy with what I've been able to figure out so far but I'm not really tied into any community or familiar with the literature so I have no idea how much of what I've been coming up with is new or novel. I'd be happy to talk about it in more detail for this reason so I can understand the relationship between what I've been doing and the existing literature. Hopefully all this isn't known or out of vogue. But I'll give you an example. Recently I came up with what I think is a satisfactory a priori account of what chain complexes are and why they exist. Given any simplicial set, we can interpret this as a formal schema for gluing together copies of a given monoid in a category and its higher tensor powers, the usual geometric realization of this is the special case where the monoidal product on Top is taken to be the join, and the distinguished monoid is the singleton space. In my opinion this gives a very good motivation for what simplicial sets "are" because for any cocomplete monoidal category C with distinguished monoid M there is a unique cocontinuous strong monoidal functor from SSet to C sending the n-simplex to M^{n+1} and preserving the unit and multiplication maps of the monoid. (Here the monoidal product on SSet is Day convolution.) Now we can characterize SAb the same way, if we say that the category C should be Ab-enriched, and tensored over Ab, say that the tensor product Ab\otimes C -&gt; C is cocontinuous in both variables. So given any simplicial Abelian group X, there is a "geometric realization" of X with respect to the monoid M, computed by a coend \int^{n\in \Delta}  X_n\otimes M^{n+1}, which tells how to glue together M and its higher tensor powers according to the face and degeneracy maps of X. It turns out that if you simply sit down and compute this coend, all the degeneracies of X dissolve and you are left with the Moore normalization of X. Similarly the cosimplicial object n \mapsto M^{n+1} has a dual kind of Moore normalization M' which is a cochain complex in C, and the original coend simplifies to \int^n N(X)_n \otimes M'_n. <br>
So, by purely computational motivations, i.e. trying to compute the "realization" of a simplicial Abelian group, we are naturally led to replace it by its Moore normalization, and this can give some a priori justification for the notion of chain complex (it is a reduction of a simplicial Abelian group which suffices for the purpose of gluing together monoids in additive categories and their higher tensor powers)</p>

<p>Hi, I am Martin. Some people probably already know me from my <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/2841/martin-brandenburg">posts </a>(sometimes I also find them via a google search and try to understand what I wrote back in, say, 2013), but anyway here is a short introduction followed by some questions.<br>
I am from Germany and finished my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1716">PhD</a> in 2014 on the interplay between algebraic geometry and category theory. Similar to Zhen Lin (from whom I learned a lot!) above, I am outside of academia since then and do lots of other stuff (animal rights activism, drumming, programming, ...), but cannot really let go of math and in particular category theory.<br>
Now my <strong>questions </strong>(if they belong to a different stream, let me know): What is the purpose of this zulip workspace? Where can I read something about its development? In which case (and this is sort of my main question!) would you prefer to ask a question here and not on mathoverflow or stackexchange and also not use the category theory mailing list? To be honest, I find the layout of zulip incredibly confusing and the structure unnecessarily complicated, and for this reason I am not really active here. But someone told me to be there and of course I am curious where all of you are hanging out. As you see, I am still trying to figure out what this is all about.</p>

<p>There are streams for people to discuss specific topics, connections of CT to other branches of math and science, a general questions stream... people often start new streams to go along with a conference, so people can ask questions and discuss in a more permanent way than zoom chat. I also suspect a lot of the activity that happens here is in the form of private group chats.</p>

<p>I think a description of the structure of Zulip has been written out a few times, but I couldn't point you to it. The top layer is "streams", these are like broad umbrella topics. Inside a stream are many "topics" that are more like specific conversations. Admins and maybe other people can rearrange these if necessary, so it's not a big deal if you start talking about something in the wrong place. You have to seek out and subscribe to streams.</p>

<p>Exactly which messages are displayed is uh, easily manipulated. So "all messages" will put everything you're subscribed to in chronological order. You can make it so you only see the messages in a stream, in a topic, in private messages, or just pms with one person, or one group chat.</p>

<p>I guess you would go to StackExchange if your have a well defined question. They tend to shut questions down if those don't fit into a specific pattern, and they don't necessarily have that much humour. But there is a <a href="#narrow/stream/229451-general.3A-off-topic/topic/math.20jokes/near/210955402">math jokes channel here</a>, though it needs a bit of reviving :-) <br>
So I think there is a space where you need more dialogue to get to understand a question than is afforded by SE, which is also very good.</p>

<p>As for why to go here rather than to a mailing list, my own answer is that "it seems to be what everyone else has done".  I don't know why they did it; maybe they also did it just because it was what everyone else did.  But once everyone is here rather than on a mailing list, you have to come here if you want to talk to them.  (-:</p>

<p>I guess one slight advantage of zulip over a mailing list is that you can choose which streams to subscribe to, and you can mute particular topics.  So if there's a long conversation going on that I'm not interested in, I can unsubscribe from that stream or mute that topic and I'll stop getting notified about it.</p>

<p>Instead of answering the question you just asked, I'll list a bunch of things people do here that you can't do on MathOverflow or Stackexchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss mathematics - actually have long conversations, rather than merely ask and answer questions in the rather rigid (but very useful) format of those other websites.</li>
<li>Let the world know what work one is doing (especially in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="274877" href="/#narrow/stream/274877-practice.3A-our-work">#practice: our work</a>).</li>
<li>Announce conferences and talks, and also discuss talks during and after they happen.</li>
<li>Plan activities.</li>
<li>Announce job openings.</li>
<li>Write papers together.  (This, and many other things, mainly happens on "private streams" that are readable only by a limited set of people.)</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, it's more of a "category theory community" than those other two websites could ever be, and also (for subtler reasons) more of a community than the category theory mailing list currently is.</p>

<p>In some ways it reminds me more of the old "usenet newsgroups", where people start discussions on many different topics.  But those just had "threads" while this has a 2-layer hierarchy: "streams", each with many "topics".</p>

<p>If you find it confusing, you're probably worrying about it too much.  It's just people talking.   That's <em>always</em> somewhat confusing, of course.  But people seem to manage okay, and the good news is that people don't fight very much here.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm James Deikun, a tech industry person who loves math and used to attend the Category Theory seminar and reading groups at CUNY before COVID.  I first got interested in categories because of This Week's Finds and have continued to be fascinated since then, learning and engaging in the occasional lightweight research, especially on optics.</p>

<p>Hello all, I'm Sean Gloumeau from Barbados! I graduated from MIT in May of 2020 in AeroAstro focusing on controls, real-time systems, telecommunications and am just about to get started on an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree in Embedded Computing Systems. Even though I absolutely love math, a calculus proof-based math class broke my spirit in my first year as an undergrad, so I decided to pursue it more as a hobby since then. Now that I'm getting into research I really want to marry math into my papers, and Category Theory has caught my eye. I really love reading Tai-Danae's pieces (including topology from a CT perspective which I'm very excited to read in its entirety), and looking into the Fong-Spivak applied CT books and lectures on YouTube. Since I have a year before I choose a research topic, my main goal is to learn as much CT, and as many examples of application, as I can! I believe lurking and interacting with others on this zulip will aid me quite a lot, so thank you all for having me <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>!</p>

<p>Hi Everyone, I'm Hart Montgomery from San Francisco, CA.  I'm a research scientist in cryptography at Fujitsu.  I've become interested in category theory through a pretty circuitous route:  over the past few years, I (with some wonderful, very smart coauthors) have written some papers connecting public-key cryptography (and more powerful cryptographic primitives, like fully homomorphic encryption if you know what that is) with mathematically structured simple primitives (i.e. one-way functions or pseudorandom functions, and again, apologies for the cryptographic terms).  It seems like mathematically structured computational hardness assumptions are required in order to build certain cryptographic primitives (and in some cases, we can prove this explicitly, although we would obviously like to be able to prove more powerful statements in this regard).  However, sometime last year, we (myself and others working on these problems) realized that we didn't have strong enough tools for handling the mathematical structure in the types of proofs we wanted to write about this, and thus needed to learn category theory.  So here I am!</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in "computational category theory," I'd love to hear your thoughts, and please feel free to reach out.  Thank you all very much for your time, and I'm looking forward to learning from this community.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words!  I took a quick look at your paper.  It looks interesting, but I haven't had time to go through the details.  In the intro, you say, "To do this, we bypass the problem of modelling cryptographical primitives categorically..." which is what we have basically tried to do.  Our formulations are probably pretty appalling to properly trained mathematicians though--some of this is due to the difficulty of modelling computational primitives, and much of it is probably due to our inexperience and lack of knowledge of category theory.  If you're interested, I can share a manuscript, although I'll need to check with my coauthors first.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the response!</p>

<p>Hehe, we took the approach we took exactly because there wasn't much developed already in the direction of cryptographic primitives done categorically, so we took advantage of the fact that zk-SNARKS can be obtained from boolean/arithmetic circuits with already developed techniques, and we focused on circuits instead.</p>

<p>Actually we have a draft where we do quite a bit more, like modeling different "generalised ways of composing" (both in sequence and in parallel, having the latter kind of upgrades our method from FSMs to Petri nets) boolean circuits, doing all this stuff for arbitrary categories and not only for FSMs, etc...</p>

<p>Hello! I'm Hugo. I graduated a few months ago from Berkeley, and I hope to apply to a math PhD program this fall.</p>
<p>I would really like to learn more about CT and computation, the fact of a connection between which is awesome. In particular, just from naively reading nLab I'd be very curious to work through a precise description of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. I've also gotten the idea that categories with various levels of axiomatized structure "admit various computations" like taking pullbacks, factoring morphisms...! And they have different "internal logics", which I don't understand. I'd really like to have an oversimplified model of the circle of ideas here.<br>
I've also just found Lawvere's 1969 article ( <a href="http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf">http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf</a> ) seeming to abstract the fixed point approach to the halting problem and Gödel's first theorem (and other stuff) to a property of CCC's. This is all absolutely incredible to me and a lot to take in. Is there any "categorical" model of computation which is Turing complete/nicely related to the classical ones?</p>
<p>I guess the question I'm ultimately going to end up asking here is, what should I do next if I want to seriously pursue these topics? In particular where should I apply to grad school? Many of the non-US centers of research seem to expect a masters before entering their PhD programs. </p>
<p>Anyone's advice, thoughts or reading recommendations would be extremely appreciated. My sincerest thanks to this community for existing and being open; that's another thing I'm struggling to wrap my head around.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Louis, beginning a masters, currently following a course on categorical logic and topos theory trying to keep my head (or at least some hair) out of the water. There is a non-zero probability that when (and if) I figure out what I'm doing with my life it will involve categories.</p>
<p>I've been here for a while but haven't posted anything yet. Thanks to Morgan and Josh for inviting me!</p>

<p>Olivia Caramello gives a yearly course on subjects related to topos theory at the master's level at the uni of Insubria. (That's beginning graduate level for y'all Americans out there.) I've heard it is rare to find courses on the subject at that level. Of course one has to hang on tight.</p>
<p>We're very few in class and I'm pretty sure she's OK with anybody who wants to pop in and listen! Classes are given online, and if you're interested you should send her an email.</p>

<p><strong>Larry Harper</strong>I am Larry (Lawrence Hueston on the list of users) Harper,  Professor Emeritus in Mathematics at UC Riverside. I have been applying CT to combinatorics since  1965 when I discovered a notion of morphism for Ford-Fulkerson flows on networks.  After several years of proving Sperner-type theorems for ranked posets (the largest antichain is the largest  rank) using FLOW morphisms, I decided to look for morphisms of other combinatorial problems.  I did not have to look very far: My first paper (1962) had solved the edge-isoperimetric problem on the graph of the n-cube and I realized that the techniques that I and others had used to solve similar problems on combinatorial structures were actually morphismological. The morphisms for those problems were analogs of symmetrization, the transformations that Jakob Steiner had used in 1840 to give the first rigorous proof of the classical isoperimetric problem in the plane. So I called the morphisms for combinatorial isoperimetric problems "Steiner operations". In 2004 I published a monograph on Steiner operations entitled, "Global Methods for Combinatorial Isoperimetric Problems". Currently I am writing another monograph entitled, "The Morphismology of Combinatorics" to summarize what I have learned since1965 about the application of morphisms and the categorial structure they generate to solving combinatorial problems.</p>

<p>Hi all. I’m Dean. I was glad to join since I was just thinking about the Baez Dolan perspective on entropy. The paper they have axiomatizes entropy but the proof itself recourses to the old view in a sense. I thought folks might like to hear about the proof I found which is both simple and stems purely from the axioms Dolan and Baez came up with (which resemble the axioms of K_0).</p>

<p>What's K_0?</p>
<p>By the way, I've written a few papers on entropy, but none with James Dolan.    </p>
<p>It reminds of this story: once I was at a conference and a Japanese fellow came up to me.  After shyly standing there for a little while, he said:</p>
<p>"Are you Baez-Dolan?"</p>

<p>We are extending the deadline for submitting regular contributions to the 16th Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science by one week. Accepted papers will be published in a volume by LNCS. </p>
<p>Abstract regular papers          31 January 2022 <br>
Submission regular papers        3 February 2022</p>
<p>We have too few submissions so far so any further contribution is extremely welcome. Topics are not confined to coalgebra theory but span the whole range of applications of category theory in science. The workshop itself will take place at ETAPS and host both Invited Speakers (Ana Sokolova, Sam Staton, and Renato Neves) as well as a special tutorial session on data languages.

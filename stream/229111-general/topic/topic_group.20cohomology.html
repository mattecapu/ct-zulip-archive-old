<p>I am working on computational aspect of Brauer monoid. At first, it looked a bit easy as a generalization of symmetry group and working with tangles. But it seems I am not very far from understanding the real elegance of this algebraic structure. I realized this after reading papers from Swedler, Haige and Novikov etc. It has also some connections with Galois cohomology. I am not a mathematician but I like to exercise my mind in abstract math thing. Can anyone help me in understanding what makes a monoid a Brauer monoid? If possible, assume I am not an expert or a good student.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281263">@Sahil Imtiyaz</span> - I know what the Brauer group of a commutative ring is, and I've written about the <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/05/the_brauer_3group.html">Brauer 3-group</a> of a commutative ring.   I may have even defined something called the Brauer monoid of a commutative ring - but I'm not sure that's what you're talking about.</p>

<p>I am working on, what I consider, a branch of science and physics, which posits that experiments can be a central aspect to science.  We model experiments as monads and so data arises naturally in the form of containers like multisets.  This is then attached to probability theory naturally as there is a natural transformation from the multiset functor to a measures functor, the finite distribution monad.  The "data science" has been completely worked out by Jacobs in "Structured Probabilistic Reasoning".  I have attached this to physics in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322766016_Experiments_and_Theories_A_Fundamental_Model">this paper</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327977298_A_Concise_Depiction_of_Cosmological_Experiments">this paper</a>.  I know there are mistakes in these papers and they are not very well written.  Regardless, perhaps we can talk about this work here.</p>

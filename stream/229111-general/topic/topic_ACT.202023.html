<p>Who will start the stream for the Applied Category Theory 2023 conference?  Today I reserved my campsite at Greenbelt Campground which is a 4 mile walk from the University of Maryland.  The cost is $20 per night.  I am an "organized group of one".  That is quite meaningful in category theory! But what would be a "disorganized group of one"?</p>

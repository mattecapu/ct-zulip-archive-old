<p>No...... your strategy can only be contingent on things in your causal past, you can't be contingent on something that happens simultaneously</p>

<p>Sure, but there is a counterfactual dependence on what simultaneous moves are available to other players and what everyone's payoff would be should they adopt a given strategy. So what I was saying is that the counterfactual reasoning of the players in the sequential game (in its open game version) is not really different from the associated simultaneous game---if it were, the first player would consider the fact that they are playing first and that the other player will observe their move and adopt a subgame perfect equilibrium strategy. So, at the syntactic/type level, open games allow for a dependence on past moves, but this dependence does not matter semantically because the second player might as well have played simultaneously and the same equilibria would be found.</p>

<p>But, ultimately, I think we're probably thinking the same thing but expressing them differently because I am confused about what constitutes compositionality for open games.</p>

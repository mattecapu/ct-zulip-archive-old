<p>Hello folks. I have been trying to learn about coalgebraic descriptions of dynamic systems like state machines. Recently I came across the "state chart" visual formalism outlined in this paper: <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf">https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf</a>, which allows for "superstates" and allows complex state diagrams to be simplified via stratification. I was wondering if these state charts can be accounted for coalgebraically, and if so, how?</p>

<p>I found this paper "Coalgebraic Semantic Framework forComponent-based Development in UML", in which they seem to use a bicategory of coalgebras and coalgebra homomorphisms. Currently trying to work my way through it</p>

<p>I'm curious about the graph and model transformation community. They use lots of flavors of pushout and adhesive categories and clearly have an overlap with bidirectional transformations (lenses) and ACT in general, but I don't see much discussion of this  on here. I gather their center-of-mass is in Europe, which maybe explains why I didn't hear much about it before going to a Dagstuhl workshop.</p>

<p>Indeed, I submitted to that conference because Fabio Gadducci was convinced that there was an overlap between what they were doing and ACT, and suggested me to submit. He's definitely the person to talk to if the goal is strenghtening these links.</p>

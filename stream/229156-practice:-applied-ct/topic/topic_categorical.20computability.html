<p>Categorical Computability in Monoidal Computer: Programs as Diagrams<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03817v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03817v1</a><br>
This is a draft of the first 7 chapters of a textbook/monograph that presents computability theory using string diagrams. The introductory chapters have been taught as graduate and undergraduate courses and evolved through 8 years of lecture notes. The later chapters contain new ideas and results about categorical computability and some first steps into computable category theory. The underlying categorical view of computation is based on monoidal categories with program evaluators, called <em>monoidal computers</em>. This categorical structure can be viewed as a single-instruction diagrammatic programming language called Run, whose only instruction is called RUN. <br>
[not sure if this is the right way to announce things. sorry if it is not. pls move if there is a better place.]</p>
<p>PS in view of the later chapters, now i think that a better title might be:<br>
Programs as Diagrams in Monoidal Computer: from Categorical Computability to Computable Categories</p>

<p>Great!  I should advertise this!</p>

<p>As much as I love the category, I'm noticing how bizarrely frustrating it is to write a mode-dependent dynamical systems (a reservoir computer in my case) using Poly constructs. When it comes to generating actual numbers for something nontrivial, debugging becomes a nightmare. It takes several minutes to do the plumbing necessary just to get the outer system to output information I can actually analyze.</p>
<p>Something obvious only happened to occurr to me this week: there's nothing Poly can do that Set can't, really. A dynamical system is just a morphism? Great, it actually is just a morphism in Set also (albeit one that is a giant composition of functions). If you care about type safety, just write Haskell code and use Debug.trace when developing something.</p>
<p>I'm asking this with love of course. I've been excited about the category and have loved working with it, but debugging it versus debugging a little matlab benchmark has caused some existential angst. "Why is anyone even doing this? is it just a cute coincidence that if you take a subcategory of the yoneda embedding you preserve the ability to express dynamical systems? is this actually practical?" etc.</p>

<p>I love this question!</p>
<p>... I probably have some things to say about it, but probably not until tomorrow</p>

<p>i should note that I have been a programmer for 11 years and have only gotten into category theory about a year ago (and in a very leisurely way. watching bartosz lectures and "reading" topos blog posts without understanding anything). i'm sure i don't have the instincts that someone like Spivak has but i feel like by now I <em>should</em> have "seen the light" and somehow grasped how obviously better Poly is for expressing certain things (i.e. it actually is more natural/practical).</p>

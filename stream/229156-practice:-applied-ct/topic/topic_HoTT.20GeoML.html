<p>I'm interested in trying to translate GeoML (GML: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language</a>), a coordinate-based markup language for expressing 3d shapes, into homotopy type theory, in such a way that the topological structure of the GML is reflected in the proof theory (the groupoids induced by propositional equality) of the resulting HoTT code.  In the same way that in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf</a> the authors calculated the homotopy groups of spheres using HoTT, I'm wondering if we could e.g. calculate some simpler thing about a real world structure for which GML exists (like a famous Church etc) using HoTT methods.  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>To elaborate, I know how to write individual shapes such as toruses in HoTT, and I have coordinate lists for shapes in the GeoML file format, such as toruses, Iâ€™m just not sure what to do to corresponding HoTT code when those shapes are found to e.g. intersect or touch.  Presumably, I should push them out or create suspensions or sewing or do other topological things, but I don't know what these would be.  I think there's probably a cool quick demo here (perhaps a 'functional pearl') if this can be worked out.</p>

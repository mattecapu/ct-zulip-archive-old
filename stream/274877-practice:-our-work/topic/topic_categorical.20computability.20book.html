<p>the book "Programs as diagrams" is complete and in production. the good news is that the contract allows me to distribute 75% for free:<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03817">https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03817</a><br>
but it needs to be updated. the bad news is that the fun stuff (categorical gossips and degeneracies) are in the other 25%. i had mistakenly compiled the whole thing... and in the meantime had to fix it. ask me at <a href="mailto:dusko@hawaii.edu">dusko@hawaii.edu</a>.</p>

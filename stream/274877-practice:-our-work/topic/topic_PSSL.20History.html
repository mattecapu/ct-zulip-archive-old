<p>Another small bit of celebration for Dana Scott's 90th Birthday: the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic (PSSL) is an informal meeting of categorists, type theorists and logicians, started in 1976 by Dana Scott, while in Oxford. There's now a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/diff/Peripatetic+Seminar+on+Sheaves+and+Logic">nLab page for it</a>, but we only have the titles of the talks till the 100th PSSL. We're missing the last 5 meetings and help providing webpages or listings of the talks for these missing meetings would be much appreciated!</p>

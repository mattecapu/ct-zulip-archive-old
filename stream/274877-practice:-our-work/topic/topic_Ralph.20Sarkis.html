<p>It won't be very long because I am a very young researcher but here's what I am working on.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am working with monads and distributive laws to model the combination of non-determinism, probability and termination as quantitative algebraic effects (in the sense of Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin - LICS2016) --- in an internship with Daniela Petrişan.</li>
<li>I am in the middle of my PhD applications.</li>
<li>I take part in a reading group on topos theory, we are reading <em>Generic Figures and Their Glueings</em>. This is a lot of fun, so I might want to start another group soon.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I like a lot about that book is that it works many examples of topos-theoretic constructions, in the concrete setting of presheaf categories where you can calculate things. The running examples include sets, graphs, reflexive graphs, and discrete dynamic systems (or "evolutive sets," as the authors call them).</p>

<ol>
<li>My internship with Daniela Petrişan resulted in this <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03261093">preprint</a> (among other results).</li>
<li>I am currently preparing an oral presentation on this internship to complete my masters.</li>

<li>I am teaching (well, for now, I am helping masters students teach) a category theory course to students in Lyon. I have made my notes available for them, so <a href="https://github.com/ralphS16/MyFirstBook/blob/master/DraftBook.pdf">here</a> they are. There are still lots of holes to fill and a big polishing step, but I am expecting to have a finished book by the end of next year.</li>

<p>I don't think I am being very productive on all fronts. I like to have many different projects so that whenever I lose focus on one, I can try to think about the others. Only 4 and 5 have real timing requirements so I can work on the first three at my own pace.</p>

<p>Hi Ralph, your work seems intriguing to me. I wonder whether you took into consideration <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14641">Rosicky's work on metric monads</a> and what would be the link between the two.</p>

<p>I have read this paper and this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03880v1">other related paper</a>, but I am not comfortable with enriched categories, locally presentable categories and accessible categories, so I don't understand every detail. From my understanding, the solution we crafted to talk about operations which are not nonexpansive (see Second extension axis in the introduction) is not something either paper can deal with.

<p>Now, our solution is to almost take a product (we take a lifting of the product) as the domain of the operation. It turns out, as our paper shows, this still leads to a nice theory (very close to Mardare et al.'s approach).</p>
<p>In order to really understand the link between our paper and Rosicky's, I would like to extend our solution to lift the function space too (i.e. have more general arities as in Ford et al.'s paper), and translate our work to the categorical language used in Rosicky's paper (the Lawvere-Linton way of doing universal algebra). I don't see how to do this right now, but I am looking for solutions, and I wanted to ask here at some point for some help.</p>

<p>In order to really understand the link between our paper and Rosicky's, I would like to extend our solution to lift the function space too (i.e. have more general arities as in Ford et al.'s paper), and translate our work to the categorical language used in Rosicky's paper (the Lawvere-Linton way of doing universal algebra). I don't see how to do this right now, but I am looking for solutions, and I wanted to ask here at some point for some help.</p>

<p>Thanks Ralph. I also told Jiri about your work, I think that's a quite cool development.</p>

<p>Quick update.</p>
<ol>
<li>My <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09087">paper</a> with Matteo Mio and Valeria Vignudelli was accepted at LICS 2022, I am implementing the reviewers' suggestions.</li>
<li>I was accepted at the adjoint school, so I have been working on this (on Fillipo Bonchi's project), and I am excited to go to Glasgow in July.</li>
<li>Next week, I am supervising an internship with a high school student. I will try to work with them on the graphical syntax for logic I discovered in <a href="https://richardblute.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/williams-novfest.mp4">Christian Williams' talk</a>. I have no idea what to expect, but I think we will have fun anyways.</li>
<li>Next month, I am giving a talk for my whole CS department on diagrammatic reasoning. I am preparing some slides, and I even prepared a thumbnail respecting the codes of YouTube (see below). </li>
<li>If nothing goes wrong <span aria-label="fingers crossed" class="emoji emoji-1f91e" role="img" title="fingers crossed">:fingers_crossed:</span>, I should be going to Montréal for a whole semester starting in August to work on quantitative algebraic reasoning with Prakash Panangaden.<br>

<p>I am getting back to you (especially <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>) on my internship.</p>
<p>I spent 4 days with a high school student (16 years old) trying to show him what research in maths/cs is. Out of those 4 days, around 1.5 days was spent on discovering the 2-dimensional syntax for relations described in <a href="https://richardblute.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/williams-novfest.mp4">Christian's talk</a>. Every time I introduced a new piece of syntax, we spent a lot of time finding examples and asking simple questions before moving on, and by the end of the week, we were able to cover relations, composition of relations, implications, vertical and horizontal composition of implications. I am not sure what to think of the end result. On the one hand, he and I had fun exploring these ideas and I believe the graphical syntax definitely helped him throughout our work. On the other hand, on the last day, he was supposed to prepare a quick explanation of what he did during the week to share with other students who did a similar internship, but he told me he was not confident enough in his understanding of relations, so we switched to a more <strong>concrete</strong> subject.</p>
<p>Let me give a bit more details. It was really hard for him to find examples and questions by himself. I think the main problem is that he is not used to abstract reasoning, and I think I was bad at pointing out the relevant patterns. For instance, whenever we dealt with composition of two relations, he had to draw the points in the colors and links between them before understanding (that's I think the main good point about the syntax: the points and links picture for a relation embeds well in the syntax). This was easier when dealing with relations between a set and itself, in particular, familial relationships (dad, cousin, grandparent, etc.) between humans and the usual orders on integers. I found he was not very enthusiastic about our findings, so I'd like to look for better examples of things to prove (for me, the best thing we have proved is that if a relation is reflexive, then it is dense, we had lots of examples of dense and non-dense relations and we figured out all dense ones were reflexive, so we showed the implication (very easily) graphically).</p>
<p>TLDR: Teaching relations to a high school student is very hard, but I believe it is less hard when using a graphical syntax.</p>

<p>We made lots of compositions with familial relations: </p>
<ul>
<li>sibling of sibling is sibling, but cousin of cousin is not cousin.</li>
<li>father of father is paternal grandfather,  father of parent is grandfather.</li>
<li>father implies parent and father implies father so we get paternal grandfather implies grandfather.</li>
<li>we looked at the chart of nth cousin nth removed and did a few of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We had person allergic to ingredient and  ingredient inside recipe implies person shouldn't try this recipe.</p>
<p>When I tried doing more abstract things we looked at the empty, identity and full relation on a set, and we saw how they compose with each other and with an arbitrary relation.</p>

<p>Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am in Montréal right now visiting Prakash Panangaden. It's fun being back here, and Prakash has so much to teach me. We are not making as much progress as I expected, but I am in no rush.</li>
<li>In meetings with Prakash, he told me that McGill has historically been very hostile to category theory (even if they had several stars who held lots of seminars in Montréal), and that is probably why the team didn't get renewed. As revenge, I have been introducing diagrammatic reasoning to anyone that would listen. I had good discussions when giving <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/MMSGSTalk.pdf">this talk</a> a couple of times.</li>
<li>I participate in biweekly discussions on pedagogy in mathematics organized by Rosalie Bélanger-Rioux. It's quite informative and it confirms my slight preference of teaching over research.</li>
<li>I am trying to accelerate my progress on my <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/CatLectures/DraftBook.pdf">category theory notes/book</a>, because I am thinking of putting a first finished version in the appendix of my thesis, so I can link to definitions/results/notation from it using the <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~colcombe/knowledge_en.html">knowledge package</a>.</li>
<li>I miss the dynamics of my lab, my office mate, and especially my supervisors in Lyon (we still meet and talk online), but I am trying to make the most of my time alone to figure out what I want to do with my thesis (this is hard!).</li>
</ol>

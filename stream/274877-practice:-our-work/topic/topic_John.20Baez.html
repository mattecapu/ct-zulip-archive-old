<p>I hope more people start saying a bit about what they're doing - this is the stream for that!   </p>
<p>Here's what I'm doing now - not including teaching.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm giving a talk on Monday March 8, 2021 at the <a href="https://theorycolloquium.phys.ethz.ch/">Zurich Theoretical Physics Colloquium</a>,  called <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/03/01/theoretical-physics-in-the-21st-century-2/">Theoretical physics in the 21st century</a>, as part of their Sustainability Week.    The talk is prepared now, I just need to give it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm preparing a talk  for Kirill Krasnov's seminar <a href="http://pirsa.org/C21001">Octonions and the Standard Model</a>.   This is giving me a chance to think about particle physics - fun!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've got to resubmit <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09363">Structured versus decorated cospans</a>, which was rejected by <em>Transactions of the AMS</em>.  The first referee said the paper was "outstanding", so they called in two more, one of whom said it used too much category theory to be easy to understand (so it should be reorganized), and the other of whom said it wasn't so interesting.    I also want to see if we can simplify the proofs using some ideas of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>.   But I think we'll resubmit it before doing that - just because it's easy to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to restart work on the paper "Schur functors" with  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>.  Our winter quarter ends this week, and the spring quarter starts on March 29th, so I have a window where I can get a lot of writing done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to prepare a talk  for Thursday March 18, 2021 for the Topos Institute seminar.   It's time to get cracking!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Wednesday April 7, 2021 I'm giving a talk at PIMS, the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, entitled <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/42/">The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything</a>.  This talk is already prepared so it's no work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to prepare talks on the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf">Rosetta Stone</a> paper and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1791">A characterization of entropy in terms of information loss</a> for the Topos Institute workshop "Finding the right abstractions: category-theoretic language for human flourishing", May 5, 12, 19.</p>

<p>Yes, I need to quickly decide if I'm going to stick with my existing talk or do a different one.</p>

<p>Here's my to-do list now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/mathematics-in-the-21st-century-2/">Mathematics in the 21st century</a> for the Topos Institute seminar this Thursday (March 25, 2021).   Brendan Fong wanted me to give a broad programmatic talk instead of a technical one, so I decided to really throw caution to the winds and talk about the future of pure mathematics, applied category theory and climate change, and how they all fit together!  I still need to polish it up... I have some ideas about creating something like a "nervous system" for the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare two talk  for Kirill Krasnov's seminar <a href="http://pirsa.org/C21001">Octonions and the Standard Model</a> on Monday April 5th and Monday April 12th.   The first one, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/can-we-understand-the-standard-model/">Can we understand the standard model?</a>, is done.  In this one I don't talk about the octonions, just the puzzle of <em>what structure is preserved by the Standard Model gauge group</em>.  I'm busy struggling to write the second talk, which is about using the exceptional Jordan algebra, and some other Jordan algebras, to make this structure more "conceptual".    I've had to do some last-minute research to pull this talk together.  Right now I'd love nothing more than to drop everything else and think about this for a few more months!   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify "Structured versus decorated cospans" with Kenny Courser and Christina Vasilakopoulou using ideas from Mike Shulman.   This will really improve the paper!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on "Schur functors" with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>.    We're going to meet a bunch next week to make progress on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Wednesday April 7, 2021 I'm giving a talk at PIMS, the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, on <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/42/">The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare talks on the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf">Rosetta Stone</a> paper and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1791">A characterization of entropy in terms of information loss</a> for the Topos Institute workshop "Finding the right abstractions: category-theoretic language for human flourishing", May 5, 12, 19.</p>

<p>A search on this CT zulip for "retiring" picks up a few times John has mentioned it.  The earliest appears to have been in December, when he said he would retire in June.</p>

<p>Interesting, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275902">@Georgios Bakirtzis</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="297784">@Jonathan Sterling</span>!  When I was really young I thought I would quit doing math after I was 40 and do something else, like writing expository books.    I got too interested in math, and also too comfortable having tenure, to make a switch like that so soon.   I probably still have research I want to do: I seem to need to do some to stay happy.  But now that I'll be able to do whatever I want, there's really no way of being sure what that will be.</p>

<p>I realized I could not write a really good column about moduli spaces of polyhedra by the deadline of June 6th.  So, I changed the subject to something I've recently been blogging about, and it got a lot easier!  I finished it up pretty quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gauss-lucas.pdf">The Gauss-Lucas theorem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone can point to places where this is unclear, I'd love to hear about it!    To whet your interest: it's easy to figure out the coefficients of the derivative of a polynomial given the coefficients of a polynomial.  But how can you figure out the <em>roots</em> of the derivative given the <em>roots</em> of the polynomial?   There's an answer that uses physics.</p>

<p>But I'm just trying to capture the intuition "the electric field of a bunch of positive charges can't vanish unless you're standing somewhere <em>among</em> those positive charges" - because if you're not <em>among</em> them, they are all pushing you away from the whole lot of them (if you're positively charged particle yourself).</p>

<p>Young diagrams are useful for almost everything, since the set of Young diagrams is the free commutative monoid on the underlying set of the free semigroup on one generator.</p>

<p>Both structured and decorated cospans turn out to be special cases of a construction invented by Mike.  Using this we can avoid  masses of computations.</p>
<p>The equivalence of the structured and decorated cospan formalisms - under some conditions - also follows nicely from Mike's work... together with   Christina and Joe Moeller's work on the monoidal Grothendieck construction, and a nice result on when opfibrations are right adjoints.

<p>It's nice to see formalisms converging... Also Myers-Spivak's approach to dynamical systems turns out to be doubly categorical, though I'm not 100% sure they're 'doubly indexed categories of systems' are framed.</p>

<p>It's exciting to me to see this construction being actually used to prove something non-obvious.  When I wrote that paper I was primarily motivated by making abstract sense out of, and carefully checking the coherence laws for, a construction that had basically already been done (the May-Sigurdsson bicategory of parametrized spectra).  Once I had the abstract construction written down, I found other examples, but until now I haven't seen an example where I was really convinced that the abstract point of view offered a significant simplification (taking that example alone) over just doing stuff by hand.  And this one doesn't even just use the construction itself, but also the fact that it's <em>functorial</em> (to deduce an equivalence between double categories of structured/decorated cospans from a simpler-to-construct equivalence of monoidal fibrations), which originally was something I included just because I was a category theorist and thought it was important in principle that everything is a functor, rather than because I had really convincing examples demanding it.</p>

<p>I'm getting excited about a bunch of ideas connected to thermodynamics.  With people at the Topos Institute and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> I'm connecting thermodynamics to category theory.   But on my own I'm trying to understand its connection to information geometry.</p>
<p>As part of this personal quest, last week Monday I blogged about symplectic and contact geometry in thermodynamics - a review of known stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/07/27/information-geometry-part-17/">Information geometry (part 17)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a warmup for discussing their appearance in probability theory and statistical mechanics.</p>

<p>This opened up the question "what is to momentum as probability is to position", and while I had a mathematical answer it required some massaging to really get a <em>good</em> answer.</p>
<p>I gave the answer here today - it's a known concept from information theory, called "surprisal":</p>

<p>I blogged about "statistical manifolds", which are manifolds parametrizing probability distributions, and "Gibbsian" statistical manifolds, where these probability distributions maximize entropy subject to constraints specified by the point on the manifold:</p>

<li><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/08/14/information-geometry-part-20/">Information geometry (part 20)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These probability distributions are called <a href="/user_uploads/21317/SwCa9JCNA04GYvDsy_AhBKTI/gibbs_distribution.jpg">Gibbs distributions</a>.</p>

These turn out to be analogous to momenta in classical mechanics - in terms of the analogy I've built up.</p>

<p>My wife Lisa and I drove to Washington DC, where she'll be working at the Center for Hellenic Studies.  We'll be staying here until about December 15th.    My life has a new texture now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On Mondays I'm meeting with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span>.  We're working on thermodynamics.   Some subset of us, definitely including Owen and me, are writing a paper called "Compositional thermostatics".   Owen will put an article about this on the Topos Institute blog pretty soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Mondays I'll also be meeting with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span>, working on his thesis.  So far a lot of it is about categories of presheaves on Lawvere theories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Wednesdays I'm meeting with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>.   Half the time we're talking about his work on formalizing <a href="https://handwiki.org/wiki/Physics:Tonti_diagram">Tonti diagrams</a> using category theory.  The other half we're meeting with a group of people working on <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2020/10/structured-cospans">software for compositional models of epidemiology</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Thursdays I'm meeting with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>.  We're talking about things like lambda-rings, Adams operations, the field with one element, and the Riemann Hypothesis.</p>

<p>Re: &ldquo;Information geometry is the study of 'statistical manifolds', which are spaces where each point is a hypothesis about some state of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I've been looking at this from a basis in logic, that is, beginning with boolean spaces, intending to extend it to real-valued measures eventually.  Here's a snippet from an old project proposal ...</p>

<p>What's up now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm gave the Perimeter Institute colloquium on Wednesday September 15th, on "The fundamental theorem of natural selection".  The video is <a href="https://www2.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/fundamental-theorem-natural-selection">here</a> and my slides are <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/fisher.pdf">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Thursday September 23 I'm giving the physics colloquium at the University of British Columbia, on "Classical mechanics versus thermodynamics".   I'll explain why the Maxwell relations in thermodynamics look just like Hamilton's equations.  Short answer: both subjects involve a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to work with Tom Leinster on revising my application for a Leverhulme Fellowship to visit Edinburgh. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to prepare a talk on economics for Nina Otter's first workshop at her <a href="https://demos-institute.org/about-us">DeMoS Institute</a>, October 1-3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On October 7th I'll meet with Nate Osgood to talk about applications of category theory to epidemiology.  He's an old friend of mine from grad school, who is now leading the COVID19 modelling for the province of Saskatchewan and also helping do it for all of Canada.   We are both involved in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>'s meetings on compositional models of epidemiology using <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/">AlgebraicJulia</a>.</p>

<p>The first means something, the second does not.</p>
<p>Thermodynamics is confusing because it studies the same manifold with many different coordinate systems.  In the case at hand we have four functions on a 2-dimensional manifold, called <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>P</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S,T,P,V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span>.   Any pair of these functions can serve as a coordinate system.</p>
<p>Partial derivatives only make sense with respect to a coordinate system: given coordinates <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x,y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> on a 2-manifold and a function <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> on this 2-manifold we write</p>

<p>In math we often fix one coordinate system at the start of a discussion, and assume all partial derivatives are taken in that coordinate system.

<p>But thermodynamics is all about jumping rapidly between different coordinate systems, so we can't let ourselves use such abbreviations!</p>

<p>The first means something, the second does not.</p>
<p>Thermodynamics is confusing because it studies the same manifold with many different coordinate systems.  In the case at hand we have four functions on a 2-dimensional manifold, called <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>P</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S,T,P,V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span>.   Any pair of these functions can serve as a coordinate system.</p>
<p>Partial derivatives only make sense with respect to a coordinate system: given coordinates <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x,y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> on a 2-manifold and a function <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> on this 2-manifold we write</p>

Of course now that I think about it, this doesn't make sense!</p>

<p>I find this puzzling again.

Let me see if this makes sense (suppose we fixed a chart and we are talking there): since we have 2 dimensions, to specify a derivative I need to give you 2 components (since a derivative is now a vector in a 2-dimensional space).

<p>Yes, basically the idea is that your coordinate charts are made of specific functions that you also care about inherently, and that the coordinate charts overlap in which functions make them up so you can't just assume what the whole chart is based on one of the coordinates, so the idea is to specify the entire chart every time you do something coordinate-dependent.</p>

<p>Right, but here they are fixing a coordinate chart at the beginning of the discussion, so the notation for partial derivative doesn't need to tell you which coordinates you're using.   It's not a good notation for when you're changing coordinates every ten seconds - for example, when the right side of an equation is using different coordinates than the left side!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me see if this makes sense (suppose we fixed a chart and we are talking there): since we have 2 dimensions, to specify a derivative I need to give you 2 components (since a derivative is now a vector in a 2-dimensional space).

<p>For a general manifold there are no coordinate frames that can be used throughout the manifold, so this isn't really a problem?</p>

<p>We can also be more ambitious if we know more about what these functions look like.   In practice the above inequalities hold almost everywhere: this is the "generic" situation.</p>

<p>What's up now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I wrote a blog article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/09/26/classical-mechanics-versus-thermodynamics-part-4/">"Classical mechanics vs thermodynamics (part 4)"</a> in which I finally answer the question "If thermodynamics is mathematically analogous to classical mechanics, what happens when you <em>quantize</em> it?   What's analogous to quantum mechanics?"     In the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">crackpot index</a>, I give 10 points for beginning the description of your theory by saying how long you have been working on it.     But I can't resist saying that I've been thinking about this since 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> on a paper called "Compositional thermostatics".   And some news: I'm going to be Owen's external advisor for a master's thesis at the University of Utrecht!   Wioletta Ruszel will be his internal thesis adviser and first examiner - she does statistical mechanics.    Gijs Heuts will be his second examiner - he does homotopy theory and derived algebraic geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working with Tom Leinster on revising my application for a Leverhulme Fellowship to visit Edinburgh. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On November 5th at noon Eastern Time I'll give a 30-45 minute talk on "Visions for the future of Physics" at the <a href="https://basic-research.org/">Basic Research Community for Physics</a>.  So I have to prepare this talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On October 7th I'll meet with Nate Osgood to talk about applications of category theory to epidemiology.  He's an old friend of mine from grad school, who is now leading the COVID19 modelling for the province of Saskatchewan and also helping do it for all of Canada.   We are both involved in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>'s meetings on compositional models of epidemiology using <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/">AlgebraicJulia</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I polished up my paper <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/?s=fisher%27s+fundamental+theorem">The fundamental theorem of natural selection</a> and submitted it for publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today I'll meet with "the categorical epidemiology gang" and lead a discussion about various more advanced tricks for using Petri nets to create large yet manageable models of the spread of epidemics.  They have various pieces of software that use Petri nets for this purpose, but the Petri nets are starting to get big and hard to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tomorrow I'll meet with Nate Osgood to talk about applications of category theory to epidemiology.  He's an old friend of mine from grad school, who is now leading the COVID19 modelling for the province of Saskatchewan and also helping do it for all of Canada.   We are both in the "categorical epidemiology gang" along with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> and others.</p>
</li>

<p>I need to deal with the errata in <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/homology-homotopy-and-applications/volume-9/issue-2/From-loop-groups-to-2-groups/hha/1201127333.full">From loop groups to 2-groups</a> that were kindly prepared by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276422">@David Michael Roberts</span>.  Sign errors, and how to fix them!   </p>

<li>
<p>On November 5th at noon Eastern Time I'll give a 30-45 minute talk on "Visions for the future of Physics" at the <a href="https://basic-research.org/">Basic Research Community for Physics</a>.  So I have to prepare this talk.</p>

<p>Nate Osgood and I had a great conversation about category theory applied to modeling in public health, esp. epidemiology, and it looks like we'll be working together on that.   I hadn't known he had made thousands of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanielOsgood/videos">YouTube videos</a> - some on category theory, many more on modeling for public health issues.</p>

<p>In particular, I conjecture that as time passes, the "stripes" you see above can be born and merge, but never die or split.  So, if you think of the solution as a string diagram, we're talking about a monoid object in a monoidal category!</p>

<p>Doesn't that mean the definition of a bump should be Galilean invariant?  Maybe in the integral form, you should be looking spots that are local maxima in any Galilean frame?  That might help smooth out those gaps ...</p>

<p>Indeed.  But this is "if" not "iff" and as Galilean transformations take any affine combination of time and space to another such affine combination, definitions that quantify over all of them are also Galilean invariant ... It's possible that the definition "a maximum along <em>some</em> direction in the xt plane" will let a bump keep its identity all the way to merging, though I wouldn't take much worse than even odds on it ...</p>

<p>Bumps also have an interesting tendency: they move from low places to high ones.  Besides being evident from the graphs in part 5, this can be seen from the form of the conserved momentum: in integral form, momentum in an interval is equal to the difference in height of its endpoints.  Combined with the fact that bumps get higher when they merge, this kind of explains the lopsided distribution of subtree sizes observed in the blog comments.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems that new bumps, or at least the really robust ones, are born from an instability of deep valleys; wavyness in shallow valleys tends to not have time to coalesce into a nice well-defined bump before it gets drawn into or crushed between existing ones.  Maybe rather than an absolute "bumps only merge once born" it's more of a thresholdy thing where the probability of an upward disturbance merging versus vanishing some other way has an S-shaped distribution based on its current magnitude.</p>

<p>That's true!</p>
<p>Right now I'm working with a bunch of people trying to formulate some conjectures and get some numerical evidence for them.   I have no hope of trying to prove them - the analysis becomes very nitty-gritty in a way that I don't enjoy.  But I'm hoping that with relatively little work we can write a paper that pushes the study of this equation toward more interesting questions than I've seen discussed so far in the literature.</p>
<p>It took a lot of hard work for people to prove that the Hilbert space of initial data for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations contain a finite-dimensional "inertial manifold" that all solutions approach exponentially fast... and to bound the dimension of this manifold.  This is cool... but it's really just the tip of the iceberg: the interesting part is <em>what solutions on this manifold look like</em>.   </p>

<p>I can definitely imagine someone like Terry Tao proving some of the conjectures I'm trying to formulate.   This equation is much less tricky than Navier-Stokes.</p>

<p>If I wanted to interest a mathematician who doesn't care about PDE, I might say the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation exhibits "Galilean-invariant chaos with an arrow of time".</p>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It came as a shock when I first realized that some of the most famous equations in thermodynamics are just the same as the most famous equations in classical mechanics — with only the names of the variables changed. It turns out that this follows from a deep and not yet completely explored analogy between the two subjects, which I will explain.</p>

<p>Mariano's paper is nice!  In the conclusions they note that Firoozbakht's conjecture contradicts some popular heuristics that use probability theory to guess the statistics of prime gaps.</p>

<p>If these heuristics are right, we should eventually see prime gaps so big they violate Firoozbakht's conjecture.  But "eventually" may be a long time.</p>

<p>Since there's not a lot of theoretical evidence for these conjectures, just empirical, I took this opportunity to explain some very basic stuff about homotopy groups of spheres.</p>

<p>But I've also put the conjectures <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/377545/which-finite-abelian-groups-arent-homotopy-groups-of-spheres">on MathOverflow</a>.   </p>
<p>These conjectures seem very hard to prove true given what people know now.   If they're false maybe someone can find a counterexample using existing techniques.  Mainly I want to encourage new thoughts on homotopy groups of spheres (a subject way beyond my technical abilities).</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps I should explicitly mention that in case anyone is puzzled!    Our conjecture that stripes never die or split applies to generic solutions on the inertial manifold.  This is not a non-generic solution, this is a case of a solution that has not yet had time to approach the inertial manifold - the finite-dimensional manifold of "eventual behaviors".    We started this solution off with random initial data.   All solutions approach the inertial manifold exponentially fast - that's the definition of an inertial manifold.    This splitting of a stripe occurs very early on, at about <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6151em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">10</span></span></span></span> and you'll notice none happen later on:</p>

<p>As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276071">@Nathaniel Virgo</span> points out, there are also various cellular automata that give pictures that typically look like morphisms in some monoidal category, or 2-morphisms in some 2-category.</p>

<p>Somehow I'm even more excited about it for a rather simple differential equation, because there the system is fundamentally continuous yet it manages to somehow behave - "typically", and "eventually" - as if it were described by a random discrete process.</p>

<p>My new blog post got picked up by Hacker News, so it's getting lots of views:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/11/28/anthocyanins/">Anthocyanins</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's about chemicals that help make autumn leaves red.  They contain rings of carbon with delocalized electrons that resonate at frequencies that let them absorb and emit photons.    My post is full of pictures of leaves I've seen here in D.C. this fall.   There's a math question buried in here, too....</p>

<p>My work with folks at the Topos Institute on compositional epidemiology is going really well - I should start blogging about it or something.</p>
<p>A bunch of people are involved.   I got really excited when Nate Osgood joined. He's been doing "computer science for public health" for 30 years, he helps Canada with their coronavirus modeling, and he's been studying category theory for a few years. Plus, he's energetic and really clear-headed!  But I guess what really tickles me is that we were best friends in grad school.</p>
<p>In one great conversation last week we figured out which ways of composing stock and flow diagrams (a popular type of model in epidemiology) are most needed.</p>
<p>And the great news is that it's a really simple case of structured cospans! That is, a stock and flow diagram has a set of "stocks", a set of "flows", and some other stuff, but we compose two such diagrams simply by doing a pushout on the set of stocks; the rest goes along for the ride.</p>
<p>There are other trickier ways to compose them, which we'd been pondering, but Nate says that most of the time professional epidemiologists compose models in this simple way.  But they do it by <em>taking two programs, reading them, and writing a new program more or less from scratch.</em></p>
<p>So, without a lot of programming we may be able to create a tool that will save the people who model COVID-19, malaria and other diseases a lot of work!</p>
<p>The Topos Institute is going to hire a programmer to help this project, and Nate and Evan Patterson are applying for a grant to teach a course on this methodology.</p>
<p>There are also two other epidemiologists involved in this gang, which is great.  Getting actual practitioners involved is crucial when trying to apply math to any subject.</p>

<p>Yes, stock and flow models should also work in finance.   But I'm trying to <em>help</em> the world: that's why I've chosen epidemiology as a place to apply categories, rather than anything whose main effect is to help rich people get more rich or powerful people get more powerful.</p>

<p>Possibly the operative phrase was "<em>main</em> effect". The majority of money in the finance sector is presumably not being spent in order to do things like access to microfinance in developing countries (or the current most altruistic scheme), or other models not aimed at minimising tax burden on the ultrawealthy/companies with profits greater than countries etc.</p>

<p>For me the best indicator for "how much of an impact I can make here" is fragmentedness. When areas are monopolized by very few individuals/ideas/corporations/practices it becomes very difficult to make an impact. When many people tackle the problem from a multitude of angles that are considered "equally promising" the chances increase</p>

<li>On Tuesday February 15 - Saturday February 19, 2022 I'll be going to a workshop on the "Mathematics of Collective Intelligence" at IPAM, the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA.  It's being run by Jacob Foster.   The idea:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>All known intelligent systems are collectives. Individual organisms are collectives of cells, which develop, heal, sense, and act. Groups of human and non-human animals use a range of mechanisms to coordinate their behavior across space and time, from flocks and swarms to organizations, institutions, and cultural traditions. Deep learning — the dominant approach to artificial intelligence — gains its power from combining simple units into complex architectures; many contemporary architectures (e.g., GANs) combine multiple learners, and multi-agent settings are a critical research frontier for AI, especially settings that integrate human and artificial agents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These examples imply that a scientific understanding of intelligence must fundamentally grapple with collective intelligence — in a much broader sense than typical usage of the term would suggest. A variety of mathematical and computational models have been developed to explain and design intelligent behavior in particular collectives. Several mathematical fields source the ideas used to build and understand these models, from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, network science, and random matrix theory to information theory, optimization, Bayesian statistics, and game theory — even applied category theory, in recent years. It remains unclear, however, whether we have the right mathematical language to provide a unified, abstract account of collective intelligence — or whether such a language is even possible! This workshop will bring together leading experts who study and model collective intelligence, as well as those who seek to understand such models. Its goal is to explore the advantages and disadvantages of existing modeling frameworks; to find collective implementations of models of individual cognition; to expand the systems and settings understood as manifesting collective intelligence; and to grow the community of researchers who study the mathematical foundations of collective intelligence.</p>

<p>It's true that explaining deRham cohomology is pushing the limit of what it makes sense to do on Twitter.  My easier tweets get more readers and probably do more good.   But I think there's also something good about giving a taste of serious math to people who wouldn't otherwise naturally bump into it.

<p>The basic idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mathematics, the Duflo isomorphism is an isomorphism between the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the invariants of its symmetric algebra. It was introduced by Michel Duflo (1977) and later generalized to arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras by Kontsevich.</p>

I've been explaining how spaces with dimension is a multiple of 4 are special.  Using these ideas you can build a 4d topological manifold that can't be made smooth -  starting from the Dynkin diagram of E8!   But we won't get that far today.

<p>There's a paper coauthored by Ken Ono that connects 1729 with, I think, mock modular forms, maybe about 5-7 years ago. Possibly in PNAS. Ramanujan was seemingly thinking about near-misses to Fermat in the n=3 case: being off by 1 gives two ways to sum three cubes to get the same answer.</p>

<p>Thanks.   Maybe you mean <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00735">The 1729 K3 surface</a> by Ono and Trebat-Leder.  It's discussed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00735">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2013, Ono searched through the Ramanujan archive at Cambridge and unearthed a page of formulas that Ramanujan wrote a year after the 1729 conversation between him and Hardy. “From the bottom of one of the boxes in the archive, I pulled out one of Ramanujan’s deathbed notes," Ono recalls. “The page mentioned 1729 along with some notes about it," said Ono.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ono and his graduate student Sarah Trebat-Leder are publishing a paper about these new insights in the journal Research in Number Theory. The paper will describe how one of Ramanujan’s formulas associated with the taxi-cab number can unearth secrets of elliptic curves. “We were able to tie the record for finding certain elliptic curves with an unexpected number of points, or solutions, without doing any heavy lifting at all," Ono explains. “Ramanujan’s formula, which he wrote on his deathbed in 1919, is that ingenious. It’s as though he left a magic key for the mathematicians of the future," Ono added.</p>

<p>I'll look at that.   Will Sawin gave me a close-to-worked-out-but-not-completely-worked-out example on MathOverflow.</p>
<p>Mrowka says maybe nobody knows a single K3 surface whose hyper-Kaehler structure is completely explicitly worked out!  That's pretty sad.   We don't need a hyper-Kaehler structure here, an almost quaternionic structure will suffice - but Sawin wasn't able to give a <em>completely</em> explicit one of those either.</p>

<ul>
<li>Categories: the Mathematics of Connection</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As we move from the paradigm of modeling one single self-contained system at a time to modeling "open systems" which interact with their - perhaps unmodeled - environment, category theory becomes a useful tool.  It gives a mathematical language to describe the interface between an open system and its environment, the process of composing open systems along their interfaces, and how the behavior of a composite system relates to the behaviors of its parts.   It is far from a silver bullet: at present, every successful application of category theory to open systems takes hard work.   But I believe we are starting to see real progress.</p>

<p>Not to derail the thread, but perhaps by 'Masters thesis' we have a slightly different idea :-) Here people do a research Masters degree that makes a thesis half or so of what a PhD thesis would be. It seems to me that this is made up of a lot of standard stuff (plus the little extra secret sauce), and that people on MO are not going to write what amounts to a whole paper just to answer a question, what with all the calculations that will be needed...</p>
<p>But perhaps it's much more than I estimate, and it could take a whole PhD thesis to sort it out.</p>

<p>This is a very elementary 25-minute talk.  Since there's not enough time to explain serious category theory to this audience, in the second half I'm trying to explain the kind of collaboration that might be required to apply category theory to "collective intelligence"... and also to hint at some of the tools and resources that are available now.</p>

<p>Since I don't know anything about "collective intelligence", I'm using a different example: compositional models of epidemiology.   It's good to know how these arose from work on electrical circuits and then chemistry, to see how the same mathematical ideas can be repurposed for different applications.</p>

<p>Good news!    Evan Patterson and Xiaoyan Li are writing software in AlgebraicJulia using structured cospans, presheaf categories and operads to make a tool to create compositional models of epidemiology.    And here's the good news: </p>
<p>In August, they and others in our group will teach a week-long course on this software in Vancouver.   This is being paid for by <a href="https://canmod.net/">CANMOD</a>, the Canadian Network for Modeling Infectious Diseases.  Interestingly, this organization has a lot of mathematicians.   So, we may even decide to teach a bit about the underlying category theory - though no such knowledge should be required to <em>use</em> the software.</p>

<p>Here is Nate's email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>I am writing to provide final confirmation that our preferred timing for the Compositional Methods for Modeling Infectious Disease event at Simon Fraser University has now been confirmed by CANMOD staff, so we're definitively good to go with this week of August 8, 2022 at Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>I am now liaising with the CANMOD staff regarding second-order issues, most notably the choice of SFU campus (the main Burnaby campus vs. downtown campus, the latter located near the ferry terminals and with far more ready subway access.).  Having lectured or organized events at both campus, I'm inclined to be open to either, have would suggested whichever is best with respect to amenities such as the on-campus lodging for instructors/TAs, catering, videorecording support, transportation access for visitors (such as ourselves!), access by other CANMOD-affiliated researchers at SFU, and good projection and black/whiteboards and -- of course -- room availability.   There are also some financial matters in terms of support for student time (primarily Xiaoyan) to aid in creation of example models.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on this front and welcome any questions or raising of issues to be considered, but with the first order logistical issues out of the way, I think that we can now focus our efforts on where they are rightly due: On preparation of quality plans and materials for the event.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your enablement of this event!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Nathaniel Osgood</p>

<p>2) By May 9th I want to submit a couple of papers or abstracts to <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/02/25/applied-category-theory-2022/">Applied Category Theory 2022</a> - that's the deadline for submissions, for people who want to give talks!   (By the way: all you folks should submit talks if you can!)</p>
<p>Nate Osgood, Xiaoyan Lie, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span>  and I are going to write and submit a paper on our work on compositional epidemiology.  The page limit is 14 pages so we'll just have room to outline the whole strategy.   By then Nate should have held a hackathon using the software we're creating, so we'll have some feedback about how well it works so far.  </p>
<p>Then there's my paper with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>  on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/thermostatics.pdf">Compositional thermostatics</a>.  Owen says he wants to give a talk about this.  But this paper is already submitted to <em>Journal of Mathematical Physics</em>, so he'll just write an abstract for a talk - 2 pages maximum.</p>

<p>3) I'm supposed to edit my old paper <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/renyi.pdf">Rényi entropy and free energy</a> and submit it to <em>Entropy</em> by July 15th.  This was rejected by a journal of statistical physics years ago, but since then 77 papers have cited it.  The journal <em>Entropy</em> asked me to submit a paper for their special issue <em>Rényi Entropy: Sixty Years Later</em>.   They said this paper would be fine.   But  they said they were going to charge me 1000 Swiss francs to publish it!   I said I'd only submit it if they waived that fee... and they said okay.</p>

<p>One key bit of "philosophy" is the equivalence between <em>complex tori</em> and <em>complex vector spaces equipped with lattices</em>.   It's used a lot in the books I'm reading but I haven't seen it stated.   It goes like this:</p>

<p>This equivalence means that studying complex tori is a lot like studying finite-dimensional complex vector spaces!  But they're no longer classified by dimension: there are tons of nonisomorphic ones of each dimension &gt; 0.</p>

<p>My next little job involves a paper called <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/renyi.pdf">Renyi entropy and free energy</a>.   I wrote this paper 11 years ago and never published it.  I polished it up a bit yesterday, and now I need to put into the format required for the journal <em>Entropy</em>, which is doing a special issue on Renyi entropy.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy">Renyi entropy</a> of a probability distribution is a generalization of the more familiar Shannon entropy: it showed up when Renyi tried to characterize Shannon entropy using a few axioms and found out that other kinds of entropy also obey those axioms!</p>

<p>The most important thing about quantum groups is that they're not groups.    They're Hopf algebras.   Any group gives a cocommutative Hopf algebra.   When you 'quantize' the group you get a non-cocommutative Hopf algebra.   More precisely, you get a family of Hopf algebras depending on a parameter <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">q</span></span></span></span> that has the physical meaning of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">ℏ</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e^\hbar</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8452em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8452em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">ℏ</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">ℏ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hbar</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord">ℏ</span></span></span></span> is Planck's constant.

<p>This works for certain groups, like simple Lie groups.</p>
<p>Quantum groups first showed up in the 1980s when people realized that for certain classical physics problems with a group of symmetries, when you quantize the problem you have to quantize the group too!   </p>
<p>And yes, this is deformation quantization.</p>

<p>Jim Dolan started wondering how some results for line bundles generalize to gerbes and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-gerbes, so I made a bunch of guesses about this and wrote them up, along with explanations of the basic ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2022/03/holomorphic_gerbes.html">Holomorphic gerbes (part 1)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have enough energy I'll go further in the case of holomorphic gerbes on complex tori.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> , don't know if this is an appropriate place to ask so feel free to move it elsewhere but I just finished reading Dr. Eugenia Cheng's  book <em>X + Y: A Mathematician's Manifesto For Rethinking Gender</em>.</p>
<p>Amongst other interesting ideas she presented, she talked about how you approach your research in a very "congressive" manner to borrow her terminology.<br>
In it she described how you have, for a number of years, been putting together a sort of weekly digest for the public on what you have been study in the realm of physics in an attempt to make your physics-based research more accessible as well as to help you understand things more. </p>
<p>Could I hear more about how you have done this and made it a sustainable habit in your life?<br>
I once tried something similar years ago but found myself seeing it more as a chore and difficult to maintain. <br>
I would love to get something going again like this for my students and colleagues.<br>
Thanks and hope you are having a great day!</p>

<p>Great!  Yes, one key for me is that explaining things I'm currently trying to understand is very helpful to me, and I openly admit it when I'm not an expert so I don't feel too much pressure to be perfect.</p>

<p>Thanks to comments on the n-Cafe I was able to prove a couple theorems about the classification of holomorphic n-gerbes... well, one of these theorems I knew already, and it's almost a definition, but the other is less trivial:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2022/04/holomorphic_gerbes_part_2.html">Holomorphic gerbes (part 2)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a classification of which smooth n-gerbes can be given a holomorphic structure.</p>

<li><strong>Motivating motives</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying the Riemann Hypothesis there is a question whose full answer still eludes us: what do the zeros of the Riemann zeta function really mean?  As a step toward answering this, André Weil proposed a series of conjectures that include a simplified version of the Riemann Hypothesis in which the meaning of the zeros becomes somewhat easier to understand.  Grothendieck and others worked for decades to prove Weil's conjectures, inventing a large chunk of modern algebraic geometry in the process.  This quest, still in part unfulfilled, led Grothendieck to dream of "motives": mysterious building blocks that could explain the zeros (and poles) of Weil's analogue of the Riemann zeta function.  This talk by a complete amateur will try to sketch some of these ideas in ways that other amateurs can enjoy.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand, but I rewrote the piece to explain the key ideas a bit more clearly:</p>
<p>1) The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a simple example of a PDE exhibiting Galilean-invariant chaos with an arrow of time.</p>
<p>2) Solutions of this equation have visible patterns with very specific behaviors: there's a way to make this into a precise conjecture, and proving this  would be a challenge for someone really good at PDE.</p>

When we have such a nontrivial endomorphism, meaning one that's not just a multiple of the identity, I bet it induces an nontrivial endomorphism of the curves weight-1 motive, so that motive can't be simple!</p>

<p>Yeah, and over a finite field there's always the Frobenius, in addition to multiplication by n (giving End rank at least 2), so it seems that I should double back and check how you're using CM for the elliptic curve here. Does it mean CM over Q or an extension thereof (this is the sage command <code>E.has_cm()</code>), and then the point counting over prime-power-order fields is a different thing?</p>

<p>In Milne's paper <a href="https://www.jmilne.org/math/xnotes/mot.html">Motives: Grothendieck's dream</a>, in section 3 he mentions there are 3 choices for the endomorphism algebra of an elliptic curve over a finite field: the field itself, a degree 2 extension of that field, or a quaternion algebra over that field!</p>

<p>My naive guess would be to look at the curve over F_4, and try some easy coordinate transformation tricks like Example 5 in <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lindrew/18.784p.pdf">https://www.mit.edu/~lindrew/18.784p.pdf</a>, remembering the minimal polynomial that gives this quadratic extension.</p>

<p>That is, the case where the weight-1 part of the curves motive is irreducible, vs when it's the sum of two irreducibles.  (Or, I hope equivalently, when the curve does not have complex multiplication, and when it does.)</p>

<p>Well, I guess the obvious first guess is that passing from the motive to the numbers in the zeta function is losing information, so if one gets complex conjugates like that, it's no big deal (the same possibility occurred to me just now as I was away from the computer)</p>

<p>Categories of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pure%20motives">[[pure motives]]</a> are defined in a way that depends on a choice of field, a choice of "adequate equivalence relation" on cycles in varieties over that field, and a choice of coefficients which you use to take linear combinations of cycles.  The last can be any commutative ring.</p>

<p>One of the Standard Conjectures implies that all the adequate equivalence relations give the same category of pure motives!</p>

<p>I believe this proves our elliptic curve is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_elliptic_curve">supersingular</a>.   (Here I'm pointing back to the Wikipedia link you showed me.)</p>

<p>So this makes me wonder: what does the zeta function for a non-supersingular curve look like? Or, what I really, mean, what numbers appear in the place of those complex conjugate pairs?</p>

<p>I don't yet know examples where the motive itself contains more information than this!   The stuff about supersingular curves doesn't prove anything - as far as I can tell.  But I also have no reason to think that all the information about a motive is contained in this "count of points".</p>

<p>Yeah, I was being a bit sloppy. I mean the function of n that "counts" the points . I know this is all just spitballing, and happy to get an answer of the form "don't know"/"that's too far afield". Thanks for your patience!</p>

<p>But actually I was mixed up.  While lighting the barbecue grill this evening I remembered the motives that appear when we break up an elliptic curve into moves <em>do</em> know if that curve is supersingular, because if so, there are 2 weight-1 motives in that decomposition, whereas otherwise there's just 1.</p>

<p>Nice! I have no idea how to match this up to the early observation relating the motive to the naive view of cycles on the complex points of the elliptic curve (treating the elliptic curves here over finite fields as being reductions of elliptic curves over the integers). Even just how one should think of the motive of an 'ordinary' elliptic curve is a bit mysterious. Perhaps it's to do with whether the number <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.0037em;">α</span></span></span></span> is an algebraic integer or not? Just  a random guess based on the musings here.</p>

<p>Yes, the reason I focused so much on elliptic curves in my talk was because they're the simplest example that illustrates the <em>mystery</em> of motives.</p>

<p>This was a fantastic talk!  I'm so glad that the conference is being recorded so that this talk will be available for posterity.  I had no idea that things like motives and the Riemann hypothesis were so closely related to ideas that are near and dear to my heart like traces in symmetric monoidal categories.</p>

<p>When you say "supertrace", is that just a fancy way of saying that you take traces in the category of chain complexes (or graded abelian groups) where the symmetry of the tensor product introduces a sign?</p>

<p>But in my world, that's always the "correct" symmetric monoidal structure on chain complexes, so taking traces with respect to it doesn't need to be emphasized with a prefix like "super-".</p>

<p>It's also intriguing to me that the extraction of point counts from motives, as you described them, seem only to be using the additivity of traces with respect to direct sums, whereas traces in appropriate contexts are also additive on exact sequences / cofiber sequences / distinguished triangles.  Does that more general sort of additivity ever come up for motives?  Is the restriction to direct sums just a simplification that you introduced for us newbies?</p>

<p>You can see this in the article <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/motivic%20Galois%20group">[[motivic Galois group]]</a>.  It cryptically says a "slight variant" of the category of motives is tannakian, i.e. the category of representations of an algebraic group, which gets called the "motivic Galois group".    </p>
<p>If you read around you'll see this "slight variant" involves sticking extra minus signs in the symmetry, keeping the same monoidal category but getting a new symmetric monoidal category!   However, I haven't yet read a really detailed explanation, so I can't tell if they're correcting the "bad" symmetry to get the one you and I would call "good", or vice versa!</p>

<p>It seems possible that the category of motives is "super-Tannakian", i.e. the category of <em>graded</em> representations of an algebraic group, with the symmetry that you and I like.  This is what I'm hoping!</p>

<p>It's probably just a simplification for us newbies, but one thing here is that the Standard Conjectures imply the category of pure Chow motives - the kind of motives I was talking about - is abelian and even semisimple!   If so, all we really need to think about in this particular case is direct sums.  But if one wants "unconditional" results not depending on these conjectures, maybe one needs more general things like non-split exact sequences or distinguished triangles.  I don't know what people do about this.</p>

<p>There's another category of motives, "pure numerical motives", which is known to be abelian and semisimple and tannakian.  I believe if the Standard Conjectures are true this category is equivalent to the category of pure Chow motives.</p>

<p>Some other people have too, including the ecologist John Harte at Berkeley, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Punit,</p>
<p>Originally I thought that the fee for virtual presentation was $160, but now I see that it is much much higher!   I am sorry to have to tell you that I will not pay that. I have no grant to cover it.  As others have observed, that is an outrageous amount of money to ask of someone who is only going to give a 20 minute presentation and not attend in person.  So please withdraw my talk.</p>
<p>At universities, I get travel expenses and an honorarium for giving a longer talk on the same topic!  I understand the reason to charge for actual attendance, but to do so for virtual participation is unacceptable to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could pass these and other’s comments on to SIAM so that in the future they set more reasonable fee requirements.</p>
<p>Stay well,</p>

For example:

sl² x + cl² x = 1 - sl² x cl² x

and they have derivatives

sl' x = - (1 + sl² x) cl x
cl' x = - (1 + cl² x) sl x

It's easier to define their inverses:

<p>Well, I took a peek at the Chudnovsky paper which is not an abstract (<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Contributions_to_the_Theory_of_Transcend.html?id=plnyBwAAQBAJ">Google Books</a>). The paper seems to be a summary of some of the state of the art in transcendence theory, so doesn't really gives proofs, but it does give some idea and pointers to the literature. It looks like it involves pretty deep elliptic curve theory!  I'll give a sample that looks relevant to the bit I asked about (bottom of page 6): </p>

<p>During the Vietnam war, Grothendieck taught math to the Hanoi University mathematics department staff, out in the countryside.   One of them named Hoàng Xuân Sính took notes.   She later did a PhD with  Grothendieck  — by correspondence! She mailed him her hand-written thesis, and later went to Paris to defend her dissertation.  </p>
<p>Besides Grothendieck, some other amazing mathematicians were on her thesis committee: Laurent Schwartz, Henri Cartan and Michel Zisman of Gabriel--Zisman fame!</p>
<p>I wrote a series of tweets about her, and then  extended these tweets into this longer article:</p>

<p><strong>Motivating motives</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying the Riemann Hypothesis there is a question whose full answer still eludes us: what do the zeros of the Riemann zeta function really mean? As a step toward answering this, André Weil proposed a series of conjectures that include a simplified version of the Riemann Hypothesis in which the meaning of the zeros becomes somewhat easier to understand. Grothendieck and others worked for decades to prove Weil's conjectures, inventing a large chunk of modern algebraic geometry in the process. This quest, still in part unfulfilled, led Grothendieck to dream of "motives": mysterious building blocks that could explain the zeros (and poles) of Weil's analogue of the Riemann zeta function. This talk by a complete amateur will try to sketch some of these ideas in ways that other amateurs can enjoy.</p>

<p>It's finally here: software that uses category theory to let you build models of dynamical systems!  We're going to train epidemiologists to use this to model the spread of disease.   My first talk on this will be Wednesday June 29 at 17:00 UTC.   You're invited! </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stock-flow/">Compositional modeling with decorated cospans</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Decorated cospans are a general framework for composing open networks and mapping them to dynamical systems. We explain this framework and illustrate it with the example of stock and flow diagrams. These diagrams are widely used in epidemiology to model the dynamics of populations. Although tools already exist for building these diagrams and simulating the systems they describe, we have created a new software package called StockFlow which uses decorated cospans to overcome some limitations of existing software. Our approach cleanly separates the syntax of stock and flow diagrams from the semantics they can be assigned. We have implemented a semantics where stock and flow diagrams are mapped to ordinary differential equations, although others are possible. We illustrate this with code in StockFlow that implements a simplified version of a COVID-19 model used in Canada. This is joint work with Xiaoyan Li, Sophie Libkind, Nathaniel Osgood and Evan Patterson.</p>

<p>Stock-flow diagrams are used to create models in epidemiology.  There's a functor mapping them to dynamical systems.</p>
<p>But the key idea in our work is 'compositional modeling'.   This lets different teams build different models and then later assemble them into a larger model.   The most popular existing software for stock-flow diagrams does not allow this.

<p>This work would be impossible without the right team!  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276053">@Brendan Fong</span> developed decorated cospans and then started the Topos Institute.   My coauthors <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> work there, and they know how to program using category theory.</p>
<p>Evan started a seminar on epidemiological modeling - and my old grad school pal <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="318832">@Nathaniel Osgood</span>  showed up, along with his grad student <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280769">@Xiaoyan Li</span>!   Nate is a computer scientist who now runs the main COVID model for the government of Canada.</p>
<p>So, all together we have serious expertise in category theory, computer science, and epidemiology.   Any two parts alone would not be enough for this project.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a useful abelian category that includes the category of smooth vector bundles on a manifold as a full subcategory, much as the category of coherent sheaves includes the category of holomorphic vector bundles on a smooth complex variety?</p>

<p>I wrote a 2-page column for the <em>AMS Notices</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/user_uploads/21317/kh4Wwsbj5prVW8NTDHDG3AeT/isbell.pdf">Isbell duality</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd appreciate comments!   It's written for a general audience of mathematicians, so I wanted to keep the category theory quite easy, so I don't really want ways to make it harder or deeper.   What I mainly hope is that it makes sense and seems intriguing.</p>
<p>As you can see, some of it is secretly an advertisement for the Yoneda embedding.  But the first half is trying to get nonexperts to think a bit more about duality.</p>

<p>I thought I did: everything after this sentence was the link.  But I'll come out and claim that Isbell duality is the claim that two functors are adjoint.</p>
<p>By the way, I doubt Isbell said it that clearly.   I get the feeling that Isbell's original paper was rather confusing by modern standards: Avery and Leinster point out that it was written just  a couple years after adjoint functors were defined, and he only handled a special case.</p>

<p>Wow, that's a great point.  Instead of doing it earlier - since I don't want to talk about adjunctions near the start - I will do it right <em>after</em> Isbell duality.  This will connect Isbell back to the discussion of vector spaces in a nice way.   It's nice to return back to the start of the paper that way.  <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>

<p>Coming from a field that does quite a bit of "research" on Twitter, you may be surprised by how this turns out. Also breaking up complex topics in small bits of information that can be contained in a tweet counteracts very nicely the overall shrinkage of our attention span in the age of social media <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></p>

<p>In general I think you won't get bad surprises. Sure, there's the average tweet troll and stuff like that, but it's nothing new. But I find it at least vaguely possible that you may end up grabbing the curiosity of some very skilled/gifted individuals that lurk on twitter and yet have never been formally exposed to these topics. Which could even result in some kind of contributions</p>

The classification of simple objects in this category.

<p><a href="https://www.jmilne.org/math/xnotes/Seattle1.html">https://www.jmilne.org/math/xnotes/Seattle1.html</a></p>
<p>I got the definition of Weil q-number wrong.  Given a prime power q, a Weil q-number is a complex number such that:</p>
<p>1) for some integer n, q^n z is an algebraic integer, <br>
2) for some integer m, |gz| = q^{m/2} for every element g in the absolute Galois group of the rationals.</p>
<p>The point, again, is that the absolute Galois group of the rationals acts on the set of Weil q-numbers, and the set of orbits is isomorphic to the set of simple numerical motives over F_q.   This is Proposition 2.6 in Milne's "Motives over finite fields'':</p>

Some functor from (nice) simplicial sets to simplicial complexes.<br>
Barycentric subdivision from simplicial complexes to simplicial complexes.<br>
The face poset functor from simplicial complexes to posets.<br>
The nerve functor from posets (or categories) to simplicial sets.</p>
<p>That's a lot of things to check, and one of them might go wrong.</p>

The main change was a new section at the end where <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> and I connect our work to the existing grungy formula-based definitions of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">λ</span></span></span></span>-rings, plethysm for symmetric functions, and the big Witt ring of a ring.   We were trying to avoid these unpleasant formulas, and we had succeeded, but it was good to add this material.</li>

<li><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span> and I got a referee's report on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/thermostatics.pdf">Compositional thermostatics</a>.   It's basically quite positive, so the only bad part is that feeling you get when you realize you'll need to rewrite some of a paper.  More work!</li>

<li>I was told that the referee will only review my 2-page expository column on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/isbell.pdf">Isbell duality</a> after I add some applications.   I don't like this - would someone say that for a paper on number theory?    But I added an application.   I doubt it will convince a skeptic that this beautiful theorem is "worthwhile".   I was trying to motivate it by its inherent beauty.   I already said it hasn't found enough applications yet, probably because not  enough people know about it.</li>

<p>Adding some applications could easily double the size of this Isbell duality paper. For me the application is that now i am emboldened to read the Avery Leinster paper, etc., whereas before I don't think I could stomach the formality. For such a gentle introduction, I am surprised that someone would even refuse to review it.</p>

<p>I think there should be a good application to the study of smooth spaces, since smooth spaces can be defined either as presheaves on the category of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> s and smooth maps, or as copresheaves.

Isbell duality provides an adjunction between the presehaves and the copresheaves, and Avery/Leinster study the fixed points of this adjunction, which are both presheaves and copresheaves.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting these lectures! On a side note, it might be helpful to provide a short description of what prerequisite knowledge is assumed or at least very handy to know. (I got about a half hour in to the first lecture, and realized I would need to read up on representation theory a little to follow... it wasn't clear from the video to me what the "dimension" of a representation would be, for example, which was introduced as a functor.)<br>
[By the way, for anyone else in my shoes here, the book "An invitation to representation theory" by Howe seems really nice - lots of examples, exercises, and clearly explained notation.]</p>
<p>It looks like these could be a lot of fun to watch. The whole theme of defining simple structures (e.g. "D-flags" on sets) and then trying to carry these over to other settings (like vector spaces) via a commutative diagram of functors seems really exciting. Ways of transferring ideas between settings like this seem so cool to me!</p>
<p>(Oh, and I now have learned what the dimension of a representation is, I think! If <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span></span></span></span> is a group which acts on a vector space <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span>, then the dimension of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> is called the dimension of the representation. Now following along seems to be going more smoothly - I was able to follow along with the first lecture!)</p>

<p>Yes, that's the definition of the dimension of a representation.  </p>
<p>Since this was a grad seminar on a new "groupoidified" approach to representation theory, I guess I automatically assumed some knowledge of representation theory.  But surprisingly little, I bet you'll find.    Did I ever use Schur's Lemma, the basic fact about representations?  I don't remember.  </p>
<p>So, Howe's book may be more than enough in most ways.    I haven't read it - do you like it?  I knew Howe back when I was at Yale; he's very good at representation theory so his idea of an "invitation" may be rather intense.  I don't know.</p>

I don't like this - would someone say that for a paper on number theory?    But I added an application.   I doubt it will convince a skeptic that this beautiful theorem is "worthwhile".   I was trying to motivate it by its inherent beauty.   I already said it hasn't found enough applications yet, probably because not  enough people know about it.</li>

<p>FWIW, the tight completion that we get as the nucleus of the isbell duality is the <em>concept category</em>, i.e. the spectral space of whatever data source the original category captured. this is an application that solves the problem of amplification ("echo chambers") which is built-in into the linear (SVD) approach to concept mining. so this application applies the isbell duality to each of your tweets about it when the IR engine decides who to display it to :)</p>

<p>re the question of applicability of number theory: whether the Pythagoreans were right that the physical space is built of numbers or not, cyberspace is definitely built of numbers.</p>
<p>as a grad student, i was in the middle of a corridor full of people working on elliptic curves. rene schoof was counting how many points they have. i couldn't wrap my mind around what could these picard groups possibly ever be used for. what kind of invariants do they present? (i guess i was interpreting klein and noether backwards.) --- 20 years later, elliptic curves became the most applied part of math, at least for a while, running behind most tunnels through cyberspace. schoof's theorem and algorithm were like engineering tools and in a certain community my main claim to fame was that i used to have an office close to his :))</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the author might be a different Howe than the one you knew. This book is by "R. Michael Howe", but there appears to also be a "Roger Evans Howe", which might  be who you were referring to(?).</p>
<p>At any rate, I've only just starting looking at that book today, but I really like it so far. I've tried to look up some basic representation theory concepts before and have generally been stymied by a mass of definitions that feel unmotivated. This book puts in just enough motivation and examples to make it flow for me without too much effort.</p>
<p>Thanks for suggesting the link on Young diagrams!</p>

<p>I got into representation theory through quantum mechanics, which provides a lot of motivation for the subject.  So does crystallography.   So does finite group theory: there are a bunch of theorems about finite groups that are most easily proved using group representations, and some whose only known proof goes that way!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi John, Xiaoyan, Sophie, Nathaniel and Evan—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a applied mathematician and statistician working with the California Department of Public Health, primarily focused on covid modeling.  From the Topos Institute blog and from John Baez twitter feed, I have been intrigued to learn about your <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08373.pdf">category theory based framework</a> for modeling compartmental models.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would one or several of you be willing to talk about this project, and ways we may be able to leverage it?  We’re working on a couple of stock/flow type modeling projects which may benefit from this approach.  One project involves modeling co-circulation of covid and flu, which results in an ODE model like the one described in your paper.  Another involves tracking immunity categories including factors like vaccination status, previous exposure to variants, waning immunity.</p>

<p><strong>Applied Category Theory: Where Are We Now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> All along, category theory has been inspired by its applications — first to algebraic topology, then algebraic geometry and logic, then computer science, and so on. Thus, the term "applied category theory", far from being an oxymoron as some have claimed, is almost redundant! However, category theory is now being applied to wide range of new subjects: physics, chemistry, epidemiology, natural language processing, game theory, project management, and many more. This raises new questions about what category theory can do, and where it will go next. We shall try to provide some answers — but more importantly, try to stimulate some productive conversations.</p>

This would be an excellent way of passing your immense knowledge to the next generation. Just an idea.</p>

<p>Thanks!    </p>
<p>It's really interesting that Samson Abramsky moved to UCL and Bob Coecke switched to working in industry (partially? entirely?).   Is there any remaining activity in what once was the enormous category theory powerhouse in the Oxford computer science department?</p>

<p>Bob has moved to industry but is still Oxford-based and there is quite a bit of back-and-forth between the CS department and Bob's group; one could say the whole thing evolved into a “hybrid” academia/industry group.</p>

<p>There has been a big problem at <em>Compositionality</em>: papers were assigned issue numbers in order of acceptance, but papers could only be published in order of issue number, so if one author took a long time to polish up their paper after it was accepted it holds up the publication of <em>all</em> papers.

<p>An approach to children's drawings based on the free group on 2 generators: the fundamental group of the Riemann sphere punctured at 0, 1, and ∞, with the two generators corresponding to loops around 0 and 1.  Any action of this group on finite sets gives a covering of the Riemann sphere branched at 0, 1, and ∞:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessin_d%27enfant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessin_d%27enfant</a></p>
<p>The case where one generator acts as the cycle (ABCDEFG) and the other acts as the permutation (AB)(CDE)(FG).    The case where one generator acts as the cycle (ABCDE) and the other acts as the permutation (A)(BCDE).   Examples of this sort give a certain class of tree-shaped children's drawings, and branched coverings of the Riemann sphere by itself defined by polynomials in one variable.</p>

<p>We pose a precise and perhaps quite difficult conjecture about the solutions of this equation, which displays 'Galilean-invariant chaos with an arrow of time'.    And we explain what that means, with pictures.</p>

<p>I was wondering how the Schur-Weyl duality works for symplectic groups, and if we would replace the group algebra <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{C}[S_n]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">C</span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.1514em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0576em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span> with the group algebra of the Weyl group for Sp(n). But it seems this is the wrong guess, instead you use something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer_algebra">Brauer algebra</a>. This is just like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{C}[S_n]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">C</span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.1514em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0576em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span>, which you can view as linear combinations of "string diagrams" for permutations, but the Brauer algebra also has cups and caps in these string diagrams. Viewed this way, the "walking Brauer-Young diagram category" (??) would be a 2-rig with duals, something like that, so we can interpret these Brauer algebra string diagrams freely...</p>

<p>I think it's neat how Jim is tying together Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant (which is about the absolute Galois group of the rationals) and Kronecker's Jugendtraum (which is about the abelianized absolute Galois groups of quadratic number fields), but it's going to take more work for him to straighten things out and for me to understand what's going on!</p>

<p>I've been writing about modes (in music) over on Mathstodon, and I put these posts together into a blog article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/11/01/modes/">Modes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short version: the 7 modes formed from the major scale have an ordering by 'brightness', and inversion (in the musical sense) reverses this ordering!   This came as a revelation to me recently, though it's been known a long time.</p>

<p>Right now Mathstodon is not accepting new memberships,  because of the flood of new applications.  But that should change soon.  Colin the Mathmo writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have temporarily suspended sign-ups ... the server is struggling, and we need to look at the best way to manage the resources.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> it's still possible for people to issue invitations, but I'm not sure.  There's a lot going on, and this is all new to me.</p>

<p>I'll be giving a talk about Noether's theorem on Wednesday February 6, 2023, as part of this physics seminar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends and colleagues,</p>
<p>On the 5th of December, we are due to start up Round II of the Algebra, Particles, and Quantum Theory seminar series.  Again we are lucky enough to have an excellent set of speakers:</p>
<p>Denjoe O'Connor  -  (On exceptional fuzzy spaces and octonions) <br>
Shogo Tanimura  -  (On superselection)<br>
John Baez  -  (On getting to the bottom of Noether's theorem)<br>
Aiyalam Balachandran  -  (On Gauss' Law:  A tale)<br>
L Glaser  -  (On reconstructing manifolds from truncated spectral triples)<br>
John Huerta  -  (On the algebra of grand unified theories)<br>
Kasia Rejzner  -  (On quantization, dequantization, and distinguished states) <br>
Lev Vaidman  -  (On many worlds)</p>
<p>For dates and times, please go to <a href="https://furey.space">https://furey.space</a></p>
<p>Talks will run about once every three weeks on Mondays.  The times will most often be 18:00 Berlin time, but this varies quite a bit due to the accommodation of time zones.</p>
<p>You can help us out by circulating this announcement in your favourite physics and math departments.  In particular, please forward this announcement to your international colleagues outside of Europe and North America.  The beauty of zoom is that it gives researchers direct access to each other, largely regardless of distance, regardless of their country's finances, and without excessively polluting the planet.</p>
<p>Finally, if you know of researchers or students wanting to be added to the mailing list, please advise them to email me at <a href="mailto:nichol@aims.ac.za">nichol@aims.ac.za</a></p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon,</p>

Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</p>

<p>This is much more aimed at epidemiologists than our <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ACT2022/">previous paper</a>, so we push all the stuff about decorated cospans to the background and focus on what our software actually <em>does</em> with them - which is nice, especially now that Nathaniel and Long Pham have produced a version that runs on the web with a graphical interface.   </p>

<p>4) On Tuesday December 6, 2022 on 11 am I'll speak at the Statistics and Data Science Seminar at Queen Mary University of London.   Nina Otter invited me to do this.  I was going to talk about maximum entropy reasoning but my research on this with Tom Leinster has not gone as fast as I wanted.</p>

I'll again speak on  decorated cospans and our epidemiology software, but this is a colloquium talk so it will be much more focused on what we do than how we do it.</p>

<p>This week Simon Willerton joined my conversation with James Dolan, so James gave a pretty self-contained introduction to the 'moduli space of acute triangles' and how it maps onto the more well-known - but less easy to explain! - 'moduli space of elliptic curves'.</p>
<p>The moduli space of acute triangles is just the space of all shapes of acute (and right) triangles with labeled vertices, counting similar triangles as the same.</p>

<p>The moduli space of acute triangles is the region outlined in orange.</p>
<p>Taking the points 0 and 1 on the real line as two vertices of your acute triangle, any point in this region can serve as the third!   You get all possible acute (and right) triangles with labeled vertices this way, where similar triangles count as the same.  </p>
<p>But if you also count triangles with different vertex labelings as the same, you just need one of the 6 black or yellow regions inside the orange outline!

<p>It's famous because any two triangles of opposite color, sharing an edge, form a copy of the 'moduli space of elliptic curves'!</p>
<p>Actually you need to glue together the edges of this region to get that moduli space, but never mind... this fact, plus what I said before, means there's a strong relation between elliptic curves (which take a degree in math to understand) and acute triangles (which any kid can understand)!</p>

<p>So, there has to be a way to take an acute triangle and get an elliptic curve from it!</p>
<p>And there is.  That's what James has been explaining in recent conversations. </p>
<p>You can take an acute triangle, build a tetrahedron with copies of this triangle as all 4 of its sides, and then form a 'branched double cover' of that tetrahedron made from 8 copies of this triangle.  This is the elliptic curve!   </p>
<p>If anyone wants to draw this or animate it, I could explain it more carefully.</p>

<p>The number of interesting people  on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez">Mathstodon</a> has been growing rapidly since the end of October, thanks to Musk's antics on Twitter.  Lately I've been having a lot of fun there, and putting in a lot of work to invigorate the conversations there.  Like most things, it's more fun when I put more work into it.

<p>Yesterday I was interviewed by Siobhan Roberts of the <em>New York Times</em> about that puzzle I posed on Mathstodon, on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/dividing-a-square-into-similar-rectangles/">dividing a square into similar rectangles</a>.  I tried to keep emphasizing that Mathstodon is a good place for collaboratively messing around with math.</p>

<p>I then found a much better discussion of it <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InfiniteCosineProductIntegral.html">here</a>.   </p>
<p>Then someone on Mathstodon named Sean O made a <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@seano/109627356107653590">vast amount of progress</a> in reducing it to the study of the "cosine Borwein integral"</p>

<p>Some substances have <strong>time reversal symmetry</strong>: they would look the same, even on the atomic level, if you made a movie of them and ran it backwards.  Some don't - these are more rare, like certain superconductors made of yttrium barium copper oxide!  Time reversal symmetry is described by an antiunitary operator <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span> that squares either to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span> or to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord">−</span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>: please take my word for this, it's a quantum thing.

<p>Similarly, some substances have <strong>charge conjugation symmetry</strong>, meaning a symmetry where we switch particles and holes: places where a particle is missing.  The 'particles' here can be rather abstract things, like 'phonons' - little vibrations of sound in a substance, which act like particles - or 'spinons' - little vibrations in the lined-up spins of electrons.  Basically any way that something can wave can, thanks to quantum mechanics, act like a particle.  And sometimes we can switch particles and holes, and a substance will act the same way!</p>
<p>Like time reversal symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry is described by an antiunitary operator <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> that can square to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>±</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pm 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord">±</span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>.

<p>Some kinds of matter have neither time reversal nor charge conjugation symmetry, but they're symmetrical under the combination of time reversal and charge conjugation!

<p>This analysis is the easiest to understand (at least for a physicist), but there's a deeper approach using Bott periodicity, which I explain <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/tenfold.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This week I've been working away on the tenfold way.  I like doing my research as blog articles.   I've described two different ways to relate Bott periodicity to symmetric spaces.   The relation between them is somewhat mysterious, but when it comes together it'll be a nice piece of category theory - or at least connected to category theory.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The importance of the tenfold way in physics was only recognized in this century. Simply put, it implies that there are ten fundamentally different kinds of matter. But it goes back to 1964, when the topologist C. T. C. Wall classified the associative real super division algebras and found ten of them. The three 'purely even' examples were already familiar: the real numbers, complex numbers and quaternions. The rest become important when we classify representations of groups or supergroups on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}/2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mord">/2</span></span></span></span>-graded Hilbert spaces. We explain this classification, its connection to Clifford algebras, and some of its implications.</p>

If anybody knows people who should organize such things, let me know!</p>
<p>In particular, I'm trying to get Nate Osgood, Evan Patterson and maybe William Waites (an epidemiologist / computer scientist who works in Strathclyde)  to organize a research group on category theory and epidemiological modeling.</p>
<p>I'm happy that Nate is really gung-ho about doing this. He wants to do a "Manhattan project" applying category theory to agent-based modeling.   (He realizes that's a bombastic way to put it.)</p>

<p>I'm going to give a public lecture in Santa Fe.  I like the unusual requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the Santa Fe Institute and our president, David Krakauer, and chair of the Community Lecture Committee, Jessica Flack, I am pleased that you have agreed to deliver a talk in Santa Fe as part of our community lecture series.</p>
<p>As you know, you will present a lecture titled “Visions for the Future of Physics” on Tuesday, October 18th at 7:30pm at the Lensic Theater. Our usual format for these evening lectures is as follows:</p>
<p>• An introduction and context setting by an SFI scientist.</p>
<p>• Five-minute personal narrative that outlines your story and how you got into your field (to give the audience – especially our younger viewers – some personal context on who you are and how you got to where you are now).</p>
<p>• Forty-minute talk on a topic of your choice (remember this is for a lay audience so try to avoid too many technical terms or long mathematical proofs).</p>
<p>• Followed by a 10-15 minute conclusion where the speaker presents a reckless idea (one that is either a bit out-there, forward looking, or one that is not fully developed). The reckless idea format can vary from speaker to speaker but should leave the audience excited for the future of your creative inquiry.</p>
<p>SFI would very much like our visitors to interact with the residential community by means of scientific collaborations as well as more informally at lunch and tea, and thus we expect visitors to spend the majority of their time on site. Please provide us as soon as possible with your provisional dates. If there are faculty members with whom you would like to meet during your visit, just let me know. We will send you an agenda in the days before your lecture.</p>
<p>We may request a few brief interviews with local news media. This extends the community outreach benefit of the lecture and helps ensure a full auditorium. These interviews typically include a 20 to 30 minute phone interview with local radio or newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>In addition, we will request slides and background materials a week or two in advance of the lecture. The lecture may be broadcast live on our YouTube page and our communications team may be live on Twitter during the event.</p>

<p>Thanks!  This talk will be somewhat similar to a talk <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/visions/">Visions for the Future of Physics</a> that I gave in 2021 (you can see slides and a video of that if you want).  I talked about how so-called "fundamental physics" is stuck, but other areas are not - and how climate change will impact research in physics.   But that was for an audience of physicists, while this is not, so this will be different!</p>

<p>Thanks!   Since the "reckless idea" should be "exciting" rather than gloomy, I'll talk about some very optimistic vision of how physics can help us build a world in harmony with the laws of ecology.   This is actually in keeping with the theme of the Santa Fe Institute, which is about complex systems.</p>

<p>it is fantastic to have these bundled together. the fact that i put it in the same folder with feynman lectures probably tells more than any set of courteous comments that i could make. i know people are busy, but maybe in the long run it could be organized to build an index.</p>
<p>for me at least, the main reason to read this is <strong>writer's voice</strong>. (the main reason to not read a commissioned handbook or britannica is that they iron out the voices of the people who wrote it.) --- this is not a matter of beauty or comfort, but of the "flow" of a theme, like in music... understanding does not come from piling up correct statements, but from weaving the ideas as they associate with one another. (that is why we make sentences. where a human grandmother says "world is full of dangers", a meerkat grandmother says "hawk, dog, snake, poisonous weed".)</p>
<p>so to be honest, i would prefer if you don't insert corrections but maybe add them somewhere. most errors are not random but carry useful information. error-free text and "authoritative sources" are the building blocks of religion, not science...</p>
<p>when i teach, i actually not only leave in the mistakes that i once made, but often add the new ones deemed interesting. at the beginning i announce that students get points for submitting correct answers or for finding mistakes in the questions and in the lecture notes. (i started doing this with the graduate classes in security protocols: you can ace the exam by proving that a protocol is secure or by finding an attack. including the exam protocol...)</p>
<p>everyone finds mistakes in the wikipedia pages and for things that i know about, they are the most valuable part: what are the rough edges of this or that idea?...</p>

<p>In a composite of two normal coverings, the group of deck transformations of the bottom stage acts on the group of deck transformations of the top stage.  In Grothendieck-Teichmüller theory, these groups of deck transformations are Galois groups, and the bottom stage is 'arithmetic' while the top stage is 'geometric'.

<p>Studying extensions of fields geometrically.  </p>
<p>A principal G-bundle over a space X gives a functor F from the category Rep(G) of representations of G to the category Vect(X) of vector bundles over X.   This functor F can be seen as a model of the theory whose syntactic category is Rep(G).   </p>
<p>We can generalize this idea while making it more precise by thinking of groups as giving commutative Hopf algebras and principal bundles as torsors.   We can then define a new general concept of 'torsor' of a commutative Hopf algebra, as follows.  </p>
<p>Choose a field k and consider the doctrine of symmetric monoidal cocomplete k-linear categories.   For any commutative Hopf algebra H, the category of comodules of H is a theory in this doctrine.   We then define a 'torsor' of H to be a model of this theory.</p>
<p>We can further generalize this by working with commutative Hopf algebroids over k, which give a certain notion of 'stack' simultaneously generalizing the concept of 'space' associated to a commutative k-algebra (namely an affine scheme over k) and the notion of 'group' associated to a commutative Hopf algebra over k (namely an affine group scheme over k).</p>
<p>Returning to the Hopf algebra case, let's do an example.   Given a finite group G we get a commutative Hopf algebra H = k^G so we can talk about a torsor of H, defined as above.  We call this a 'G-torsor over k'.   </p>
<p>Unraveling the definitions, a G-torsor over k is a symmetric monoidal colimit-preserving k-linear functor F:  Rep(G) → C where C is some symmetric monoidal cocomplete k-linear category.   We can even describe this more explicitly.</p>
<p>Bringing it down to earth, take C = Vect and G = Z/2.   We can understand quadratic extensions of the rationals as Z/2-torsors over k, and check that such things are indeed classified by square-free integers.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> , I was trawling through your website and Azimuth and I was trying to find an answer to my question of, "What are you up to now in tackling the issue of climate change?" I couldn't find what you are working on right now regarding climate change -- at least in the past couple months. I was more motivated by curiosity here as to how you are tying category theory to problems within climate change. Would you mind sharing? If you have time and inclination of course -- Thanks!</p>

<p>Definition of group object G and group action in an arbitrary cartesian category.  The definition of G-torsor can almost be done at this level of generality, but we need a way to rule out things such as the action of a group on the empty set.  Digression on the 'group with no elements':</p>

<p>Studying abelian extensions of fields using torsors.  The case of quadratic extensions of the rationals was relatively easy because ℤ/2 'splits' over the rational numbers: that is, all irreducible representations of ℤ/2 on rational vector spaces are 1-dimensional.

There are 30 such subgroups, and we construct a chart of 12 of them mimicking the method used on February 16th, 2023 for the 20th cyclotomic field.</p>

<p>Some good news: Grothendieck's student <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/06/20/hong-xun-snh/">Hoàng Xuân Sính</a> is turning 90 this year! And the university she founded, Thang Long University, is having its 35th anniversary! They’re putting out a book in her honor, and they’ve asked me to write a few words about her thesis - because I've worked on that subject and also written about her life.</p>
<p>This will be fun, since her work on 2-groups (or "Gr-categories") is now being used in theoretical condensed matter physics and quantum field theory.</p>

<p>I had fun looking at the "Motivating Motives" paper for a bit! I learned a little bit about a few things I've never looked at before, and feel somewhat more inclined to learn about related things in the future. In particular, I really enjoyed the example of the "correction term" for the number of solutions of the polynomial equation over finite fields. It gives a sense of something deep and mysterious going on, which seems in the spirit.</p>
<p>I was able to (roughly) follow the paper until the talk of the "pieces" of a torus on page 7. I assume that my lack of background knowledge is kicking in at this point, but just in case you find it helpful, here are some particular things that felt like they contributed to my confusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paper doesn't define "elliptic curve", but seems to use some (unknown to me) definition. I'm happy to say that a polynomial equation defines an elliptic curve if its complex solutions form a torus with one point removed. But I don't know what an elliptic curve is from this. Is it a set of solution points over a specified finite field? Possibly instead the set of complex solutions? These phrases seem to refer to some definition along these lines: "To get the full elliptic curve we should include that extra point, even when working with a finite field" and "four pieces of the complex version of the elliptic curve, which is a torus".</li>
<li>The talk of pieces of elliptic curves is then difficult for me from the start, because I'm not exactly sure what's being discussed. Are we discussing subsets of a solution set for a polynomial equation over a specified finite field? Or possibly subsets of the solution set of a polynomial equation over the complex numbers?</li>
<li>As an example of a particular point of confusion: "The pieces of dimension k correspond to terms in the above formula that grow like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>q</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q^{k/2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.0824em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">q</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.888em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span><span class="mord mtight">/2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>." I wasn't sure what "growing like" meant here - what variable are we talking about changing that makes things increase?

<li>Another related point of confusion: "Now, it may seem reasonable that the piece of dimension 2 contributes q points to the elliptic curve." I don't know what the piece of dimension 2 is. Are we talking about the term <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8588em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> used to count solutions? Are we maybe talking about a 2D subset of the complex solutions for our polynomial equation? Maybe we're talking about the complex solutions of the equation somehow providing solutions of the equation over some finite field?</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume this is likely all very clear to someone with enough background, though!</p>

<p>I can clarify this.  This was supposed to be the definition of elliptic curve!   In other words: suppose a polynomial equation has complex solutions that form a torus with one point removed.  Then its complex solutions, together with one extra point, are called an <strong>elliptic curve</strong>.  That's what an elliptic curve is.</p>

<p>So, your nervousness about this suggests that I wasn't clear enough here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crucially, it gives an example of an "elliptic curve''.  Instead of defining elliptic curves, let me simply state a key fact about them: if a polynomial equation in two variables defines an elliptic curve, its space of <strong>complex</strong> solutions is a torus with one point removed.</p>

<p>If my audience <em>only</em> included people who didn't know about elliptic curves, I would have said this was the definition of elliptic curve... and it would be good enough.</p>

<p>But it's bad if someone who doesn't know about elliptic curves is nervous about what I wrote.    The mathematicians I talk to most are very used to absorbing expository text that's <em>packed</em> with definitions they don't know; they file away the facts they learn and maybe look up the definition later, focusing on getting the 'big picture'.  But not everyone wants to read stuff that has words in it that aren't defined.</p>

<p>The talk of pieces of elliptic curves is then difficult for me from the start, because I'm not exactly sure what's being discussed. Are we discussing subsets of a solution set for a polynomial equation over a specified finite field? Or possibly subsets of the solution set of a polynomial equation over the complex numbers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay.   When discussing the 4 pieces I was talking about the version over the complex numbers, because I was showing you a picture of a torus.</p>

<p>The weird thing about motives is that we use ideas from the complex numbers to <em>motivate</em> ideas for finite fields.  When we dig deep enough into what Grothendieck did, we learn why this makes sense.  But it's not supposed to be obvious: on the contrary, it's profound.</p>

<p>I think punctuation after display mathematics is unaesthetic and does not aid readability. A full stop acts as a sentence terminator, but display mathematics can also serve as an effective sentence terminator. The goal of punctuation is to aid readability, after all, and sometimes including punctuation directly after display mathematics can have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Yes!  I discovered yesterday that people have written a lot about Schur functors applied to motives: they turn out to be very important!

<p>If you ever get interested in seeing Schur functors applied to motives, try Chapter 5 of this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob P. Murre, Jan Nagel and Chris A. M. Peters, <em>Lectures on the Theory of Pure Motives</em>, University Lecture Series 61, AMS, Providence, 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I'd discovered this book much sooner, since it's really good.</p>

<p>Yes, it's very nice how this stuff works.   This is why Grothendieck liked motives so much: they turn certain portions of algebraic geometry into something very much like linear algebra.</p>

<p>Thanks to Paul-Andre Mellies I learned that Drinfeld had renamed star-autonomous categories "Grothendieck-Verdier categories", because they are very important in algebraic geometry!   So there's a cool connection between linear logic and algebraic geometry, which I would like to explore now that I'm starting to learn a bit of algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>That's a good idea! I try to understand the connections between not the star-autonomous part of linear logic but the exponential modality and Schur functors as well as other families of functors and well, I've already learned a lot of things while doing that (just the symmetric powers in characteristic 0 are already giving me a lot of work to do!).</p>

<p>I think that every time a part of math is understood in some logical language (example: toposes, model theory, dependent type theory, homotopy type theory), that's a very good progress and because linear algebra is central in math, linear logic should be very important for math too! But that's difficult to make people understand that you should use different languages when all mathematics have been based on set theory + classical logic  for at least one century. (Even if people seem to forget that they are using this each time they define any set or make any proof by contradiction because they never had any course explicitly on "set theory" or "classical logic", they just learned to use sets and classical logic without paying attention).</p>

<p>What did you use to understand algebraic geometry? Everybody agrees that most of the books are difficult to understand. For instance, the definition of a scheme is huge. So what would be the easiest path to have the prerequisites say for reading "Lecture on the Theory of Pure Motives"?</p>

<p>Great.  There are lots of roads to algebraic geometry!  For example I can imagine you being sufficiently interested in Schur functors, Young diagrams and similar things that you start reading Fulton and  Harris' book <em>Representation Theory — a First Course</em> to learn about how they show up in representation theory, and getting pulled into algebraic geometry that way (since it talks a lot about algebraic geometry in a nice elementary way).</p>

Now the problem is that the set of zeroes of a polynomial map is not a vector space so I can't translate the set of zeroes  to any symmetric monoidal category and define it with a coequalizer or some other (co)limit or other way. If I've read correctly, it's an affine algebraic variety but I don't know how to make this stuff categorical so I'm not very satisfied...

<p>If I can categorify the idea of set of zeroes of a polynomial map (or polynomial) after that I would be excited by translating facts from algebraic geometry in this categorical theory but I'm far from having this categorical theory <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>It's probably to use this "sets of zeros of a polynomial map is an affine algebraic variety" idea (which is correct) as an excuse to learn about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz">Nullstellensatz</a>, which is often considered the fundamental theorem of algebraic geometry, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_generated_algebra">finitely generated algebras</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/affine+scheme">affine schemes</a>.   Even if they aren't exactly the tools you need for your particular problem, they're all important ways of relating polynomial algebras to vector spaces.   It's all very categorical if you do it all very categorically, but it's good to just learn about it the way ordinary folks do, too.</p>

<p>Hmm yes, there is a lot to learn to put some algebra on this set and find axioms and make this categorical, and the Nullstellensatz seems to be the first step, so at least I have a question in my head to be excited now and I understand that it is not simple...</p>

<p>This (edit: that motives are set-like things that help count corrections to numbers of points) is an interesting observation. I know nothing about motives and never progressed past the point of briefly absorbing the definition of a scheme before promptly forgetting it, but I know a fair amount of practical linear algebra. In that vein, one tool that I've found profoundly capable in many applied settings is magnitude--or actually, weightings (whose sum is magnitude). Here too for a finite metric space one has a notion of "effective number of points" and in practical computations that number can and often is negative: basically, the effective size of a point (its weighting component) is big and positive for an "outlier", slightly smaller and negative "just behind" an outlier, and roughly unity everywhere else (in fact there are oscillatory corrections IIRC). I am not an analyst but I am given to understand via work of Mark Meckes that a weighting is secretly a Bessel potential, which forms a lovely and surprising connection between potential theory/PDE and all that and enriched category theory. Anyway as you know magnitude has a categorification that works in very general settings. Your description of motives makes me wonder if perhaps there is some actual or "potential" connection between magnitude and motives.</p>

<p>Okay, here's a list of things I've done or should be doing:</p>
<p>1) I just submitted my paper <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/motives.pdf">Motivating motives</a> to the arXiv and to the Grothendieck Conference proceedings, so now it's time for something new.</p>
<p>2) The next thing I need to do by a deadline is prepare this talk for Cohl Furey's physics seminar by May 15th:</p>
<p><strong>Symmetric Spaces and the Tenfold Way</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The tenfold way has many manifestations.  It began as a tenfold classification of states of matter based on their behavior under time reversal and charge conjugation.  Mathematically, it relies on the fact that there are ten super division algebra and ten kinds of Clifford algebras, where two Clifford algebras are of the same kind if they have equivalent categories of representations.  But Cartan also showed that there are ten infinite families of compact symmetric spaces!  After explaining symmetric spaces, we describe two ways to get compact symmetric spaces from Clifford algebras, which give <em>different</em> correspondences between these two manifestations of the<br>
tenfold way.</p>
<p>So, I have to get back to thinking about the tenfold way.</p>
<p>3)  Jessica Flack has invited me to give a public lecture for the Santa Fe Institute. So, I'll go to Santa Fe from Friday May 19 to Wednesday May 24, and by then I need to prepare this talk:</p>
<p><strong>Visions for the Future of Physics</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The 20th century was, arguably, the century of physics. While there was immense progress on so-called “fundamental physics” — the basic laws governing matter, space, and time — fundamental physics has slowed to a crawl since 1980, despite an immense amount of work. But as John Baez will explain in this SFI Community Lecture, there is exciting progress in other branches of physics: for example, using the fundamental physics we already know to design surprising new forms of matter. Like all other sciences in the 21st century, physics must also embrace the challenges of the Anthropocene: the era in which humanity is a dominant influence on the Earth’s climate and biosphere. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4) By June 1st I need to submit a proposal for a 6-week work session in Edinburgh on using category theory to design software for agent-based models in epidemiology.  I'm doing this with Nathaniel Osgood, who knows more about agent-based models, so I'm hoping he'll do most of the work on the proposal... but I think I need to get it started.</p>
<p>5) However, I have enough time now to finish checking all the corrections David Roberts made to my paper <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/2group.pdf">From loop groups to 2-groups</a>, and submit a new version to the arXiv, and an erratum to <em>Homology, Homotopy and Applications</em>.  So I'll start doing this today.</p>

<p>Ok, let's inaugurate this stream.  The idea was for people to share something in personal threads about what they're working on right now, following on what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> did in another stream.   So here's what I'm working on right now research-wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finish <em>The univalence principle</em> with Benedikt Ahrens and Paige North, a much longer elaboration of <em>A Higher Structure Identity Principle</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;redacted&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revise and submit <em>All (∞,1)-toposes have strict univalent universes</em> for publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revise <em>Constructing symmetric monoidal bicategories functorially</em> (with Linde Wester Hansen), <em>Linear logic for constructive mathematics</em>, and <em>A practical type theory for symmetric monoidal categories</em> based on referee reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand my categorical logic notes into a textbook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various less-well-defined pending projects about HoTT and its semantics, including modal dependent type theory (with Dan Licata and Mitchell Riley), modeling HITs, modeling cubical type theories, modeling HoTT in elementary/realizability (∞,1)-toposes, stack semantics of 1-toposes, and impredicative constructions of HITs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of unfinished projects involving <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\ast</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.46528em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">∗</span></span></span></span>-autonomous categories.</p>

<p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>This is something I have been thinking for a long time, and even considering to start writing such a thing. Yet, I consider this as a very hard project. Categorical logic is many things, and more importantly it is a collection of point of views (type theory, universal algebra, functorial semantics, axiomatizations of categories of structures), it is also "many communities" to pay tribute to... my honest opinion is that in a way, we need more a Handbook of Categorical Logic then a book whose title is "Categorical Logic". In both cases, I would love to collaborate to such a project.</p>

<p>On a much more general level, I partially dislike the idea of declarating what we are working on.</p>
<p>In order to motivate this, let me provide a very concrete example. In your personal nlab wiki you started describing the broad project of 2-categorical logic. What one sees on the nlab is a collection of statements that mostly puts together the standard australian literature on the topic. Yet, from time to time I have seen people saying "Shulman's treatment of n-categorical logic". Now, as a young researcher I am very interesting on the topic, but one feels like all the theorems I could be proving somehow already have a name on them, even though as a fact no publication, nor preprint discusses them. I do understand that it was not your intention to "delimiter your territory", but one should consider, especially with such an influent character, that this is the possible outcome of such a thing.</p>
<p>Now, I am sure that some people will come here and say "Are you saying that you do mathematics to pur your name on it?", and I honestly believe that on a very human level, the answer to this question is at least partially always yes. To be more precise, what I would definitely dislike is if I prove something and someone else gets his/her name on it. This is very different from "I want my name on stuff", it's just "I don't like when someone eventually get his/her name attached to everything just because he or she is sufficiently famous or influent".</p>

<p>On a similar note, I am very fond of categorical logic and type theory and have found existing textbooks to be dissatifying (tending to be too narrow in focus, be insufficiently thorough, or be simply not up to date with modern developments). I read through your notes a while ago, and enjoyed the presentation. I would be happy to volunteer to proof read drafts of the new/updated sections.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277318">@Ivan Di Liberti</span> I totally agree that categorical logic is a collection of points of views.  My notes and hoped-for textbook were explicitly designed to present <em>one</em> point of view that I felt was lacking from the literature -- hence, in fact, why the working title is "Categorical logic from a categorical point of view"!  I'm doing my best to respect and mention other points of view, but I want the presentation to be coherent from a particular one, which the reader can then contrast themselves with other presentations by other authors who are more qualified to present other points of view.  For the same reason, though I appreciate the offer of help, this is one project that I want to do all on my own, because I have a fairly coherent point of view and I don't want to have to compromise it.  However, I totally agree that a "Handbook of Categorical Logic" would <em>also</em> be a useful thing, if someone else (hint, hint) wanted to organize it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="341237">@Fawzi Hreiki</span> I'm not quite sure what you mean by "model-theoretic stuff".  The notes are already focused on the categorical models of type theory rather than the syntax.  If you mean the subject that's traditionally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory">model theory</a>, then no, I'm not going to write about that.</p>

<p>Well I guess the way I understand it, there are two notions or layers of model theory in categorical logic. </p>
<p>There’s the question of presenting certain kinds of categories syntactically (via generators and relations) and reasoning internal to them (using deduction rules). <br>
So, like how we can present and reason in CCCs using lambda calculus.  </p>
<p>There’s also the question of studying what the corresponding categories of models look like (by homming into sets or some other ‘big’ category). </p>
<p>A lot has been done on the model theory of ‘lower strength’ logics (e.g. propositional, algebraic, predicate) but I haven’t really seen much on the model theory of higher or dependent types.</p>

<p>A classical example is of course Stone duality for propositional logic, or Gabriel-Ulmer duality for essentially algebraic logic.</p>

<p>But maybe as we go up in the strength hierarchy, the categories of models become less interesting than what the syntactic categories themselves look like (since the syntactic categories are becoming ‘bigger’ and the categories of models ‘smaller’)</p>

I'm doing my best to respect and mention other points of view, but I want the presentation to be coherent from a particular one, which the reader can then contrast themselves with other presentations by other authors who are more qualified to present other points of view.  For the same reason, though I appreciate the offer of help, this is one project that I want to do all on my own, because I have a fairly coherent point of view and I don't want to have to compromise it.  However, I totally agree that a "Handbook of Categorical Logic" would <em>also</em> be a useful thing, if someone else (hint, hint) wanted to organize it.</p>

<p>I totally see your point. CatLog from a categorical point of view is definitely missing in the panorama!</p>

<p>I'd really like to understand this better... have you done a talk on it?<br>
The example equation "tr(fg)=...=tr(gf)" on page 4: it looks like it goes in the reverse order to the string diagram calculation in Figure 1. Is that right? If so maybe you should change the order so that it agrees with Figure 1.</p>

<p>It struck me at the time that it bears a similarity to the Dual Calculus (a la Wadler) however with a different interaction between terms and coterms. I am working on formulating a (co)term structure for it (which will not be "complete" (in some sense of the word) in the first instance) to investigate its reduction properties. The Chu construction could likely serve as a syntactic translation from the putative calculus into the STLC. I have not done much yet as I have been solidifying my understanding of the various basic properties and proofs of the STLC. From a more categorical perspective I have been thinking about how it could be modelled but I am less clear on the details on this side of things.</p>

<p>This only very briefly occurred to me when writing out my earlier message so I have not thought about it much. Dual calculi have been interpreted using CPS translations; and, my thinking was that the Chu construction might correspond to something similar. My putative calculus appears to not be pre-evidently linear but does appear to have linear-like properties (I believe that this is down to the infinitely-contraposable nature of implication). This linear-like structure could somehow bear on the nature of this translation compared to the classical CPS translations.</p>

<p>My vision of the Chu-Shulman translation (if that's what we're to call it) is as one of these translations that isn't often used directly, but rather we frequently work in its image. Other examples are the Gödel-Gentzen translation (showing a way of weakening statements in intuitionistic logic) and the translation from extensional to intensional type theory that gives us setoids. I'd like to see other uses, though!</p>

<p>At least the Chu-Shulman translation has the advantage that its source theory is both expressive and well behaved, which gives it a better chance of being used directly than the other two I mentioned.</p>

<p>well, I thought this (thinking of assertion+anti-assertions) was more like Dialectica than Chu, as one of the differences between the constructions is exactly that the relations in Dialectica allow you to negate, as oppose to simply transpose, the matrix of truth-values.  </p>
<p>But indeed very interesting the idea of  connecting this idea to the Herbelin's calculus.</p>

<p>This is a slight sidetrack, but maybe there's a link: In <em>Affine logic for constructive mathematics</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07518">https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07518</a> you talk about "affine sets", which turn out to be something rather interesting. Have you ever thought about what "relevant sets" would be? That is, you lose weakening, but add contraction, in the underlying logic? I have been fooling around with monoidal categories with diagonals for various reasons, and these should give semantics for certain relevance logics (variations on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relevance+monoidal+category">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relevance+monoidal+category</a>, with possibly fewer assumptions, based on the flavour of relevance logic), but I can't exactly say what a "relevant set" is.  Possibly this is a big and gnarly topic, but do you have any intuition (hah)?</p>

<p>Well, you can perform the same construction that I did to get "affine sets" on any linear hyperdoctrine, including any "relevance" one.  As to where a relevance hyperdoctrine might come from, I have fewer ideas.  I don't know of an obvious instance of a Chu or Dialectica construction that would end up being relevance, but I guess you could take the canonical indexing of a relevance monoidal category like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mo>∗</mo></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rm Set_*</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Se</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.175696em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∗</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> over Set.</p>

<p>Well, it's been a very educational experience.  I kind of want to recommend that everyone interested in type theory should try writing their own toy proof assistant at some point.  (I probably wouldn't recommend trying to implement higher-order unification, though.  Ugh.)</p>

<p>Personally, I started because I was inventing a new type theory that I wanted to play around with in a proof assistant, and I wasn't able to find any existing tool that would let me do that.  (Which doesn't necessarily mean there aren't any -- the conversation after <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="438119">@Florian Rabe</span>'s colloquium made me think that I should give MMT another try.)</p>

<p>Since I've been in this situation several times before, of wanting to play around with a new type theory but not having any way to do it, I decided to try to implement something a bit more general that could be used as a framework library to implement multiple different object languages.</p>

<p>So the underlying framework type theory is, at the moment, a plain dependent type theory, but playing the role of a logical framework in which to implement object theories with specified typechecking and reduction behavior.</p>

<p>Yes, I think there's a fast-growing need for such a tool. I wanted to do something similar a couple of years ago, and wrote a type-checker/interpreter whose metatheory was based on a higher-order version of generalised algebraic theories with rewrites, but it becomes obvious very quickly how much work is required to move from "type-checker" to "proof assistant".</p>

<p>The main thing I was missing in the existing tools was more flexibility in specifying my normalization algorithm.  In particular, I wanted to specify "rewriting" or "reduction" rules that none of the existing tools I tried would accept as fitting into their rigid notion of what a "rewrite" is.  So my system allows the implementer of an object theory to write more or less arbitrary code to specify the result of a reduction on an object-language symbol.</p>

<p>Isabelle lets you use arbitrary ML code; MMT lets you use Scala instead. That ends up making a difference (I tried doing things with MMT, but I really don't like the code style that Scala forces on me, and abandoned that direction). It's too bad that Andromeda development seems stalled right now, as it was quite promising.</p>

<p>Scala3 has a much stronger formal underpinning (see  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07298.pdf">this more recent paper</a>). I wonder if that is going to make a difference to MMT.</p>

<p>Andromeda also looked very promising to me.  But when I tried actually using it I got stuck, not just because it's unfinished, but also because despite the fact that it "supports" arbitrary equality rules in theory, to make something usable in practice it seems you're mostly restricted to equalities that fit within the supplied equality-checking algorithm, and mine didn't.</p>

<p>There are indeed many different 'tactic' styles. The styles that hide a lot of computation in an unobservable medium annoy me - it's all black magic that does not provide much explanation. Proofs should have explanatory power (they do in normal mathematics). Proofs whose contents is merely "it's true, really, I've checked, you don't need to worry about it" feel rather unsatisfying.  PVS's <code>grind</code> is perhaps the worst offender!</p>
<p>Even though I have published a lot of papers on meta-programming, somehow the MTAC language as a means to give instructions on how to build my proofs doesn't really resonate with me. I agree 100% that Agda hides that part, because that is mostly done in an invisible way in the IDE (the equivalent of 'intro' and 'intros' and 'case split' and ... all exist in Agda too, but they are IDE "gestures" rather that residuated in the proof).</p>
<p>As it turns out, for the kinds of results that I'm interested in, the explicit proof terms are very important to me. So I like seeing them, Agda/Idris style.   Whether it's PL meta-theory or category theory in a constructive setting, I like to be forced to do explicit equational proofs. One huge advantage: when doing n-category theory, one can immediately see what will be hard work in (n+1)-category theory. This is also a huge disadvantage if you have no intention of going there!  It's a similar issue with strict/weak, for that matter.</p>
<p>Note that, for the exact example of <code>associativity</code>, that can be done in Agda, in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm very happy for the proliferation of systems. The design space is huge, and it should be well explored. And I don't think there is a global optimum, just local ones, that cater to different styles.</p>

<p>As to using reflection (in Agda): it is indeed extremely powerful, and people have just started exploring. The one thing it can't do is to create new top-level bindings, and that was exactly the kind of meta-programming I was looking for...  But as far as proof-level meta-programming, as far as I can tell, it's merely a matter of effort to program it all, there are no issues with the implementation that would block things.</p>

<p>Tactics don't make proof terms invisible.  You always have the option to write them out explicitly, or to print them after you've constructed them with tactics.</p>

<p>Andrej Bauer likes to point out that in no usable proof assistant do you actually write "proof terms" in the actual underlying formal system; there is always a computation step even if it's just elaboration and unification.  Given that, why not give the user full access to that computational level?</p>

<p>I don't think even a reflection-style proof in Agda, no matter how fancy it can get, can be "replayed" in the same way you can step through a tactic proof in Coq or Lean.  This is a big advantage because simply reading a proof assistant file, whether it's a tactic proof script or a proof term, is very hard to understand directly, especially for a working mathematician.  Stepping through it and seeing the givens and goals at each stage is much closer to the way mathematicians think when they read or write a proof.  Yes, this is a stylistic issue, but just as a large enough quantitative difference becomes qualitative, a large enough stylistic difference becomes objective.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can claim that the only reason Coq has many more big formalization projects (the odd order theorem, the four-color theorem, CompCert, FIat Crypto) is that it's older and more mature.  But I think it's also significant that Lean, which is also tactic-based and much younger than Agda, has already had an astonishing degree of uptake among "working" mathematicians.</p>

<p>Well, the available implementations are all we have to talk about.  If someone claims that the disadvantages of hole-style proofs are not intrinsic to that style, then I would say it's incumbent on them to prove it by exhibiting an implementation that avoids them.  (-:</p>

<p>I "learned" the same lesson from Andrej as well. He is indeed correct. And I agree that having first-class access to elaboration is an excellent idea. [Idris pioneered that, BTW.  Tactics a la LCF didn't quite go that far.</p>
<p>And you are correct on the next point as well: Agda-style proofs cannot be replayed. The end result is that I feel like I can read my Agda proofs directly, while for Coq proofs, one is more-or-less obligated to interactively replay them.</p>
<p>It is also impossible to deny the success (size-wise) of Coq and Lean. Lean has the huge advantage of having core developers (on the language side) who have actively learned from the pros/cons of its predecessors, as well as having the enormous advantage of breaking backwards compatibility (4 times...).  Coq keeps losing people when they do the same - different communities react differently. (One can see the same in MathOverflow vs StackOverflow.)</p>
<p>One still has to be careful. This debate has much in common with the OO vs functional debate. The debate is healthy when it is being held by people who have genuinely tried the alternatives and made a choice, evil when it's done by a 'fan'.</p>

<p>I don't see why any given proof assistant has to restrict itself to one style.  The comparison to OO vs functional programming is <em>a propos</em> -- some of the nicest (IMHO) modern languages, like Scala and OCaml, incorporate both OO and functional features, allowing the user to choose which is most appropriate for their particular situation or stylistic preference.</p>

<p>For the record, I have used Agda myself -- not as extensively as Coq, but for several fairly substantial projects -- and there are definitely situations in which it shines comparatively.  For instance, working with large families of mutual inductive or inductive-inductive types is much more pleasant/possible in Agda.  Of course a tactic-based proof assistant could provide better support for such things than Coq does, but I suspect there are some intrinsic advantages to hole-style in that situation.</p>

<p>Talking about varieties of styles to write down proofs in a proof assistant, Coq has at least 5 quite distinct tactic languages/metalanguages (Ltac, Ltac2, MtacX, Elpi, Gallina through Metacoq's plugin). And you can get closer to agda style program/proof writing with Equations.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like Platt to support both styles.  I also have an idea for a sort of intermediate style that works with proof terms and holes but records the sequence of hole-filling, so that with proper tool support you can view the context and type of each hole along with the term that filled it.  The idea is that if you write just <code>f ? a</code>, then <code>?</code> is a hole that's reported to the user with its context and type.  But when you "fill" it with a term like <code>g a b</code>, instead of that term replacing the hole to get <code>f (g a b) a</code>, it comes after it delimited by a semicolon (or something): <code>f ? a ; g a b</code>.  Semantically this means the stame as <code>f (g a b) a</code>, so the semicolon is sort of a backwards let-binding akin to <code>let ? = g a b in f ? a</code>.  The difference is that the type of <code>?</code> is still inferred from its use point in <code>f ? a</code>, with the term <code>g a b</code> being checked against that type.  Multiple holes can also be chained, with the same term being obtainable as <code>f ? a ; g ? b ; a</code> or <code>f ? ? ; g a b ; a</code>; the question-marks "go onto a queue" as they are encountered and semicolons fill them in order.</p>

<p>Then in the process of checking the proof, the proof assistant knows the types of each <code>?</code> and can display them to the user with a suitable interface.  I did some experiments with this, using an emacs mode with commands to move around between the <code>?</code>s in a completed term and show their types, and I found it quite pleasant.</p>

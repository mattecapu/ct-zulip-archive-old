<p><a href="https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/16804">I'll be talking at the JMM session on topology, algebra, and geometry in data science on 5 Jan.</a> Among other things, I'll be briefly advertising/ranting about magnitude homology and prospective applications for it. </p>
<p>The underlying position paper is <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03688966">here</a>. (FWIW, arXiv seemed to really get wrapped around the axle about the "advertisement" and/or "rant" language: HAL is much more permissive with that and using PDFs instead of killing yourself with LaTeX wrangling). </p>
<p>I won't be talking about more concrete applications of magnitude to various problems in optimization, but some of these are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11677">here</a> , <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3520304.3534006">here</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10037">here</a>.</p>
<p>I will be missing the ACT days and most of the rest too, but also won't be representing my employer when I am around, so if anyone wants to give me a piece of their mind (in exchange for a piece of mine) they are most welcome.</p>

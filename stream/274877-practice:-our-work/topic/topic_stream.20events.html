<p>this looks like a nice way to conceivably weave conversations with work.  i honestly admire that a lot, but cannot say that i understand it. i was giving the worst possible talks in the world, doing research until 15 minutes before the talk, until someone told me that finding results and communicating them were two completely disjoint parts of the craft, like making a song and singing a song... but some of the best songs come about by people trying to sing other songs. jazz glorifies that.</p>
<p>incidentally, it seems theat there is a stream practice: our papers as well. are these two streams different?</p>

<p>The stream <a class="stream" data-stream-id="258900" href="/#narrow/stream/258900-practice.3A-our-papers">#practice: our papers</a> is for articles that announce a new paper you've written.</p>

<p>I suggested <a class="stream" data-stream-id="274877" href="/#narrow/stream/274877-practice.3A-our-work">#practice: our work</a> as a place for people to talk more generally about their work plans: their to-do lists, and things like that.  In short: stuff we're doing, not stuff we've done.</p>

<p>I'm always curious about what people are actually doing.   There's often a cloud of activity that's more interesting than the drip-drip-drip of  individual papers.</p>

<p>This stream is good for each person to have their own topic for any personal work/plans/notes. Feel free to make your own space.</p>

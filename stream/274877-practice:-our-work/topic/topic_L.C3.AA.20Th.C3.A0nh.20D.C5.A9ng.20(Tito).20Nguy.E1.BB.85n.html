<p>I'm not sure what's the best / most appropriate way to advertise this, but in connection with Gordon Plotkin's future Topos Institute Berkeley Seminar talk <a href="https://topos.site/berkeley-seminar/">https://topos.site/berkeley-seminar/</a> I would like to announce that I have obtained a characterization of what he calls the "nonuniformly definable" functions in the simply typed λ-calculus, making essential use of the results (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08413">https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08413</a>) that he's going to present in the talk (at least according to his abstract).</p>
<p>While I have not yet finished writing a paper on it I have had the opportunity to present my discovery at a seminar of the University of Warsaw recently:<br>
<a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/aktualnosci/seminaria/transducer-model-simply-typed-l-definable-functions">https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/aktualnosci/seminaria/transducer-model-simply-typed-l-definable-functions</a></p>
<p>As said in the above abstract, the characterisation uses an automaton model, in line with my work with Pierre Pradic on "implicit automata in typed λ-calculi". See our first paper on the topic<br>
<a href="https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~pierrepradic/aperiodic.pdf">https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~pierrepradic/aperiodic.pdf</a><br>
for a brief introduction to the perspective we've been developing, or Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis defended last year<br>
<a href="https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf">https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf</a><br>
for a more lengthy overview of this research programme. (In fact the result I'm announcing here positively answers Conjecture 1.4.3 in my thesis.)</p>

<p>While I'm at it, let me mention that I also know a way to prove Prof. Plotkin's result using the standard set-theoretic semantics of the simply typed λ-calculus instead of Scott domains, by adapting Statman's approach from the following paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007204000661">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168007204000661</a></p>

<p>I also have some slides from an older talk (I hadn't yet proved my conjecture) geared towards an audience of automata theorists, but which may still be helpful to understand what it is I'm talking about: <a href="https://nguyentito.eu/2022-06-delta.pdf">https://nguyentito.eu/2022-06-delta.pdf</a></p>

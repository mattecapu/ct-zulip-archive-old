<p>I am researching how cognitive frameworks in our minds manifest in advanced mathematics, where we run up against the limits of our imagination.  Currently, I am collecting and analyzing all manner of examples of adjunctions with the hope of systematizing them in a way that would reveal an inherent mental structure underlying the possibilities.  Here are my notes so far <a href="https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/ClassifyAdjunctions">https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/ClassifyAdjunctions</a>  I will be attending the Applied Category Theory 2023 conference where I look forward to learning how and why people think about adjunctions.  I appreciate your comments, ideas and suggestions!</p>

<p>I am researching how cognitive frameworks in our minds manifest in advanced mathematics, where we run up against the limits of our imagination.  Currently, I am collecting and analyzing all manner of examples of adjunctions with the hope of systematizing them in a way that would reveal an inherent mental structure underlying the possibilities.  Here are my notes so far <a href="https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/ClassifyAdjunctions">https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/ClassifyAdjunctions</a>  I will be attending the Applied Category Theory 2023 conference where I look forward to learning how and why people think about adjunctions.  I appreciate your comments, ideas and suggestions!</p>

<p>I share a diagram of my current, preliminary understanding. I think adjunctions express mathematical analogies that relate two worlds (categories)  The analogy depends on two metaphors (functors). One metaphor (the left adjoint) pre-processes the input and the other metaphor (the right adjoint) post-processes the output.  The purpose of the analogy is to yield shared meaning in two different contexts, a synchronized window relating the two worlds.  <br>
There seem to be four ways to mediate shared meaning through a variable.  Free-forgetful adjunctions manifest Whether a variable signifies (by freely generating or forgetting).  Galois connections manifest What a variable signifies (the content or the context). Logical quantifiers manifest How a variable signifies: a free variable is bound, either by specifying it ("there exists") or by not specifying it ("for all"). Thus here the variable is explicitly understood as a functor with both a left and right adjoint.  This is also the case for Colimit-Limit adjunctions, which show Why a variable signifies, namely, the same variable is propagated to different locations in propositions, thus we deal with a diagram, which we interpret in terms of internal structure (colimits) or external relationships (limits).   <br>
Finally, there are two ways of establishing shared meaning through a slot for a variable.  The tensor-hom adjunction can be set up with regard to some object A. But also there is a similar adjunction that centers on a change of rings.  I need to understand this all better but I feel I am making progress!  Thank you for helping me with ideas and suggestions!<br>

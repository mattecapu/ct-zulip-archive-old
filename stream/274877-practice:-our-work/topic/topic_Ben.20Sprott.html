<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Ben Sprott </p>
<p>I was a member of The Perimeter Institute in 2003.  My advisor was Lucien Hardy.  I was a student of and research assistant to Prakash Panangaden in 2009.</p>
<p>I am working on a derivation of a new form of quantum theory that is relevant to quantum gravity.  It requires a monad composition.  These are very tricky and we have seen Zwart et al. warn against going head on without real care.  I have shown my general framework to a major titan in category theory for probability and he says it is time for me to proceed with applying it to new physics, which is what this post is about.  I would like to invite the community to message me and help me with the monad composition.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Ben Sprott</p>

<p>Go ahead with the details, what monads are you composing?</p>

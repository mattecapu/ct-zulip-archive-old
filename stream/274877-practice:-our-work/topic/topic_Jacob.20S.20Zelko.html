<p>It'll take me a little bit to respond to this Jade (holiday season here where I am at -- family craziness ensuing accordingly). Would you mind sharing a bit more about your surprise and thoughts in the interim? To give a first pass at an answer, this is more an attempt at exploring how this could be useful in the context of my work and research. It's an open question that I am pursuing at the moment.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276037">@Jade Master</span> ! I was thinking some more on your question:</p>
<p>So for my research, I have been working in the domain of observational health research which uses as a data source, retrospective data like patient medical claims, electronic health records, etc. A couple significant components to this research has been 1) Structuring this data in a meaningful and standardized way 2) Developing definitions of disease using a variety of medical ontologies  and 3) Extracting patient cohorts from this data based on 1 and 2 to draw potential conclusions in the context of retrospective studies. 1 has been somewhat solved in my space thanks to a format known as the OMOP Common Data Model which has been adopted internationally for working with this sort of data. 2 and 3 are very much an open questions that I am exploring and working on.</p>

<p>In truth, I am still very nascent in my understandings of category theory and am openly exploring how category theory could be used in work such as this. Some things that I have been openly exploring within intersecting observational health research and category theory are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describing disease definitions using pullbacks into different medical ontologies to reconstruct disease definitions across different studies</li>
<li>Exploring the use of ontology logs to describe patients matching to a specific disease definition (began to more rigorously explore this thought here: <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145</a>) </li>
<li>Thinking around CatLab with how I could use a combination of ACSets and Directed Wiring Diagrams to represent my study and chain my work together with other collaborators I work with</li>
</ol>
<p>I apologize if the above sounds entirely inane or puerile but I can't help but feel there is something here when approached from a category theory sense. For me, disease definitions boil down in some cases to sets and family of sets that work very well within the category of <strong>Set</strong>, there feels to be a relationship I can develop between disease definitions and the medical ontologies that were used, and I would love to someday have the ability to treat a given observational study as almost "filters" (in a signal processing sense) to create novel studies on patients (e.g. say a study A exists that characterizes depression across age group and race and a study B that characterizes sexual minorities, it would be so cool to compose A and B together to create a study C that characterizes depression across sexual minorities' age group and race).</p>

<p>Good luck!   I don't know where you're planning to go to grad school.  If you get a math PhD in the US, you'll typically take 2 years of courses and going to seminars, learning lots of math and pondering which advisor to work with, before starting your thesis.  If you get a math PhD in the UK you'll typically start writing your PhD right away.</p>

<p>I like how the US approach doesn't force you to start a thesis before you've developed your thinking for a couple of years.  </p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I have a big personal announcement that has been in the works for quite a while: I just got accepted into the Applied Mathematics Master's Program at Northeastern University and I will be starting this Fall 2023 in Boston. Additionally, I will be joining Northeastern's Roux Institute as a trainee and affiliate for their first ever student cohort. I'll be leaving Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control soon and relocate to Boston sometime this summer to begin my studies later this Fall. I am extremely excited about this opportunity to intersect my work in health informatics with various fields of applied mathematics!</p>
<p>I am working on transitioning from my background as a biomedical engineer and research engineer into an applied mathematics student role. I've been trying to prepare my brain to think more like a mathematician and gain fundamental skills mathematicians should have. I've had some background in maths due to my engineering training (partial and ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, SIR modeling, calculus, etc.) but not from the unique mathematician point of view. Are there any books or resources you all would suggest I look into or read? Another way of phrasing that question is if you had to start your mathematics journey over again, what resources or tools would you recommend to your past self?</p>
<p>Thanks folks! </p>
<p>P.S. I have been working through some resources/skills for the past couple months and am happy to share if that would help with providing thoughts.</p>

<p>When I came into mathematics from a computer science background, I started in abstract algebra. It's a different way of thinking than either discrete math or "engineering math" (i.e. diff eqs) and thus is good for expanding your mind. I recommend <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/104">https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/104</a> for a good intro/reference that is category theoretic, but I would also encourage you to go and take advantage of the time you have to learn things slowly in your master's, and take either an undergrad or graduate course in algebra.</p>
<p>It's probably not something that you would naturally come across in an applied math master's, but it will give you a leg up to have a solid understanding of algebra; you'll come out with a different perspective on things than you would otherwise.</p>

<p>"Algebra: Chapter 0" is great! I'm slowing chipping away at it, which I find very enjoyable.</p>

<p>One thing <em>missing</em> here is a good introduction to abstract algebra - by which I mean one that's fun and explains a lot of insights in words, not one that's encyclopedic.</p>

<p>Do folks here think <em>Algebra: Chapter 0</em> is good in that way, or mainly just good for category theorists.  (My recommendations on that page were not meant to be good only for people who like category theory.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I agree that a good understanding of abstract algebra is a great way to start "thinking like a pure mathematician", which is a useful skill even for people who mainly want to be applied mathematicians, engineers, physicists, etc.</p>

<p>It's also crucial if you want to learn category theory, since most books on category theory draw lots of examples from abstract algebra.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> -- thanks for all the thoughts here and kind words! Reading your blog post makes me giddy as this is a tool that I was thinking about making myself but you already have it laid out so nicely; a kind of fundamental math learner's road map! I am beyond excited to be starting in this journey in a more formal way. The CT community really played a role in the decision as well as I kept thinking, "If only I had more time to study X" or "If only I knew more about Y" as I read through all the amazing conversations here. It dawned on me that, "wait, why don't I just go to grad school to study these things?" and the rest has been history!</p>

<p>Great!   I hope grad school goes well.  You will probably - hopefully! - run into a lot of math questions, and don't be shy about asking them here, even if they're not category theory:  surely <a class="stream" data-stream-id="266967" href="/#narrow/stream/266967-general.3A-mathematics">#general: mathematics</a> is a fine place to ask such questions.</p>

<p>Hey folks! I am excited to share a paper pre-print that I wrote for IEEE Computer Based Medical Systems was just released on arXiv here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06504">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06504</a> If I were to explain the niche of the paper and how it helps in "the literature", it provides a series of suggestions on interdisciplinary teams to effectively develop phenotype definitions thoughtfully and equitably across the greater health informatics community (not just for OHDSI) regardless of whether they are an engineer, clinician, software developer, or public health policy expert.</p>
<p>A dream that I have further down the road is to more represent such definitions of disease using things like Directed Wiring Diagrams and Petri Nets in the exciting ways that folks at Topos and University of Florida have been doing (like Drs. Sophie Libkind, James Fairbanks, Evan Patterson, and David Spivak). I've been playing a lot with Ontology Logs as communication tool as well in my free time to see how effective it could be as an explanation tool or visual for interdiscplinary teams. My thoughts on its use in my world of health informatics are still pending! </p>
<p>Either way, I am intending to write a blog post that goes along with this paper to make it more broadly accessible. Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions on that paper; happy to chat! Especially on what could be possible with intersecting health informatics with ACT!</p>

<p>Hey! I havenâ€™t been active here in several months. I just wanted to stop by and share a blog post I wrote about the Eudoxus construction of the real numbers:<br>
<a href="https://cofree.coffee/~verity/Eudoxus.html">https://cofree.coffee/~verity/Eudoxus.html</a></p>
<p>Of course I learned about the construction on the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eudoxus+real+number">nlab</a>, and I decided to blog about it once I had the insight that itâ€™s all about slope! This is why function composition gives multiplication in this setting. And in particular itâ€™s about slope as we could interpret it from a graphing calculator: pixelated lines aka integer functions.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s the key insight in the blogpost and if youâ€™re too advanced you might not get a whole lot out of it, but I tried to make it more accessible and explain the intuition behind whatâ€™s happening, with some graphs to help explain. Iâ€™m also really proud of my efforts styling it as well ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>I have another post on <a href="https://cofree.coffee/~verity/parser.html">LR(1) parsing</a> that Iâ€™m hoping to turn into a series. And I hope to keep posting on other topics too. Interactive type theory, intricacies of FRP, music notation â€“ weâ€™ll see.</p>
<p>P.S. If you have any easily-digestible references on what decidability means, I would be happy to link to them. Decidability comes up with monotonicity and defining inverses. Itâ€™s cool to see those issues in this setting: you need to know whether an integer function is representing a positive or negative slope before you can monoticize it or define its inverse. Contrast that with Cauchy reals, where you can roughly define the data of the inverse for an arbitrary sequence, but need to know that the sequence converges away from zero to prove that the inverse sequence converges.</p>

<p>Decidability comes up in constructive settings, as it's trivial in a classical one. nlab has <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/decidable+subset">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/decidable+subset</a>, which also links to decidable equality and decidable objects.</p>

<p>Yeah. Ideally I'd like something that explains in some depth why some properties are undecidable and what that means without using a ton of jargon, and how it differs from proving a property/knowing from a proof that the property holds. I just liked to the Wikipedia page on computable sets for now: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_set</a>. It does a little better on the jargon front than the nlab but doesn't have a lot of depth either.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem</a> might be a bit better as an intro?</p>

<p>Your post on parsing is fantastic! I was looking for something like that to show to my students... thanks! =)</p>

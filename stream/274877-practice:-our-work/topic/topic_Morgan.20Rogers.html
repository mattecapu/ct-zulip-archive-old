<p>Having just uploaded my paper on topological monoid actions to the arXiv (which I will post about on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="258900" href="/#narrow/stream/258900-practice.3A-our-papers">#practice: our papers</a> once it's online tomorrow), now seems like a good time to take stock on what I'm up to.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, my ongoing collaborations, which are at varying levels of activity:<ul>
<li>With <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="282722">Jens Hemelaer</span>, work on toposes of discrete monoid actions and geometric morphisms between them. Our current project is an exploration of what factorization systems for geometric morphisms look like in this special case. We have most of a paper on the "Root" of a monoid tucked away too, which we should eventually get around to finishing.</li>
<li>With <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="284376">Riccardo Zanfa</span>, work on (Street) fibrations, especially between categories with pullbacks and toposes. That work may depend on...</li>
<li>With <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276092">Nathanael Arkor</span>, a small project on free cocompletions of (internal) categories with respect to manageable classes of colimit.</li>
<li>With <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276037">Jade Master</span>, a (currently dormant) investigation of whether or not the category of symmetric monoidal categories is monadic over the category of Petri nets, and more generally whether the category of Q-categories is monadic over the category of Q-nets for a Lawvere theory Q.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The third entry above will help me understand the right construction of syntactic categories for <strong>supercompactly generated theories</strong>, which is what I'm calling theories classified by supercompactly generated toposes. While it's of course possible to express these as geometric theories, the canonical sites for supercompactly generated toposes are <em>reductive sites</em>, which are characterized by the existence of particular colimits, and I would like to develop a standalone syntax for such categories.</li>
<li>Whatever the outcome of the preceding point, I want to extract a characterization of theories classified by toposes of topological monoid actions. This will be the key step in making <strong>Topological Semi-Galois Theory</strong>, the analogue of Galois Theory with monoids in place of groups, a viable tool.</li>
<li>The final thing I'm hoping to get done before my PhD ends (in October <span aria-label="dizzy" class="emoji emoji-1f635" role="img" title="dizzy">:dizzy:</span> ) is to establish what the semi-Galois analogue of the classical Galois theory of field extensions should be. I already have some idea of what this will look like, but I need to do a lot more work to clarify the picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the end of my PhD... It's clear that some of the work above is going to have to take place after my PhD ends. If you happen to be or know someone who can offer me a post-doc position where any of the above would be relevant, then please get in touch <span aria-label="stuck out tongue wink" class="emoji emoji-1f61c" role="img" title="stuck out tongue wink">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span> .</p>

<p>This stream has a lot of big names posting in it, so I figure it would be nice thesis-writing procrastination to update my own thread, since I'm just a student. Here's what I've got on in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finish writing my thesis.</strong></li>
<li>Find a CT postdoc or alternatively some funding to pursue research into AI ethics/philosophy, both preferably in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a bit shorter than other folks' entries; I hope that's relatable.</p>

<p>Update: thesis done! I had a breakthrough in the last month that I couldn't resist squeezing in. It's a relief to have submitted it.</p>

<p>I defended my thesis last Tuesday. Should be up on the arXiv today.<br>
I'm a doctor now yay!</p>

<p>Those of you that have spoken to me in the past 6 months or more probably know that I am doing a research project on AI Safety. I figure I might as well share what I've done so far here, in case there is some interest. The aim of the project is to provide some formal grounding for the intuitive concept of <strong>goal-directedness</strong>, a notion which appears in many stories about how sufficiently capable AI could go bad.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X9KKqgZa7edknKPm/goal-directedness-my-baseline-beliefs">preliminary post</a> I discuss the ideas I had about this before the project began.<br>
In my <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJPRC3cgtxSXpZEQZ/goal-directedness-exploring-explanations">first real post</a> I talked about criteria for judging explanations, since this is a tool I want to apply to assessing goal-directedness.<br>
In my <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oZCeun2v3Xd3ncrHt/goal-directedness-imperfect-reasoning-limited-knowledge-and">second post</a> I break down the structure of explanations with the intent of giving more flexibility to what counts as goal-directed behaviour.</p>
<p>Category theory gets a mention in the last post, although only incidentally (because I happen to include the category of world models that one could use as a parameter).</p>

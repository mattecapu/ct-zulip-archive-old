<p>I'm working with Stephen Wolfram to add tetration, hyperoperators and infinite power towers to Mathematica Functions. Before I can do that I need to publish my work. After fifty years of lone research, I'm now working with others and it is really improving the quality of my work. I just learned about the politics of convergence proofs from Yiannis Galidakis who alerted me about it in analytic continuation. People don't want to see innovative convergence proofs, they want to deal with convergence proofs like they have dealt with before and that means analytic continuation. My recent good news is functional equation are usually used in analytic continuation and I know the functional equations that describe the continuations.</p>

<p>I've been plodding along on the project to index This Weeks Finds due to personal issues and the difficulty of the problem. </p>
<ol>
<li>Index the ASCII version for simplicity's sake.</li>
<li>Language for text parsing - Perl, Mathematica, ect.</li>
<li>Difficulty indexing phrases like "4-dimensional topological quantum field theory."</li>
<li>Approaches </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Pure automation</li>
<li>Custom GUI to facilitate human editing  </li>
<li>Combination of automation and GUI</li>
<li>Support for massive editing by a number of people</li>
</ul>

<p>It's possible this is not a great use of your time!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  I strongly believe in doing social service. I support intellectually and politically both you and this forum. But my professional background is in software development and it is where I'm currently most effective.  While I do math, I need to multitask in order to keep my mind supple.</p>

<p>Great!  But it could be that some other project is a better use of your time.</p>

<p>It depends a lot on how hard it turns out to be to create an index!</p>

<p>I'm making enough progress indexing TWF that collective issues are arising. I'm reporting in so that folks have time to provide feedback on  where the project is going. </p>
<p><strong> Indexing on the cheap </strong><br>
Compared to statically indexing TWF, Google provides relevance based indexing.<br>
<a href="https://google.com">Google index for gravity on TWF site</a> and use " site:<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez">math.ucr.edu/home/baez</a> gravity". The TWF contains the word "gravity" 1420 times, which is not common in the English language. Using an API for Google and Wikipedia could be helpful.</p>
<p><strong> A home for the index </strong><br>
I could host the index with my resources, but that might not be appropriate. A nice index would be a work in process, so it would be best if I had edit rights. </p>
<p><strong> Additive and subtractive editing </strong><br>
Indexing the TWF is easy; backing frequently used words out takes more work. I currently am using a list of the one hundred most common English words.  The first three hundred TWF are comprised of 37775 different words (including things like digits and URLs).</p>
<p><strong> Mathematica </strong><br>
I'm able to do much of the heavy lifting with a relatively few lines of Mathematica. Text analysis and word clouds are supported by Mathematica although my computer with 12G RAM struggles with medium size word clouds.</p>
